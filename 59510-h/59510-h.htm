  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It is now nearly forty years since the death of
my grandfather, Dr Southwood Smith, and with
this distance of time lying between him and us,
it may not be uninteresting to this generation to
look back upon the origin of some of the great
social reforms which have now reached such wide
proportions, and to see these reforms as gathered
round the life of a man who was in the forefront
of the noble army which promoted them.</p>

<p class='c002'>He, one of the first to seize a truth, one of the
most indomitable to persevere in the promulgation
of it when perceived, went straight forward
until it prevailed, and thus became instrumental
in conferring some of the widest benefits which
have come to us in this century.</p>

<p class='c002'>From his great grief in early manhood he but
emerged the stronger. The force of his condensed
<a id='Page_viii'></a>sorrow produced an energy which carried
all before it, and resulted in the strength of his
middle age and the serenity of his latter years.
In order that such a life&mdash;crowned by its humility&mdash;might
not pass away without some permanent
record of its nobleness, the following memoir has
been written.</p>

<p class='c002'>I must apologise for the frequent allusion, in
the midst of grave public questions, to my own
recollections; but since all the early years of my
life were passed at my grandfather's side, it has
been difficult to avoid this.</p>

<p class='c002'>Moreover, I have hoped that something picturesque
and touching would be found in the
relation of the strong man and little child, who
worked together at various public causes, playing
together in the bright intervals, and that something
of the reverent enthusiasm he inspired in
that child might pass, through her, to those
who read these pages.</p>

  <h2 id='intro' class='c005'>INTRODUCTION. <br /> RECOLLECTIONS OF MY GRANDFATHER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>My first recollection of my grandfather is of him
in his study. As a little child my bed stood in
his room, and when he got up, as he used to do
in the early mornings, to write, he would take me
in his arms, still fast asleep, carry me down-stairs
to his study with him, and lay me on the sofa,
wrapped in blankets which had been arranged for
me overnight.</p>

<p class='c002'>So when first I opened my eyes in the silent
room I saw him there, a man of some fifty years,
bending over a table covered with papers, the
light of his shaded reading-lamp shining on his
forehead and glancing down upon the papers as
<a id='Page_2'></a>he leant over his writing, and the firelight flickering
on the other parts of the room.</p>

<p class='c002'>The silence and the earnestness seemed wonderful
and beautiful. It was strange to watch him
when he did not know it. It seemed to me, then,
that he had been working so through the whole
night, and that some great good which I could
only dimly understand was to come of it.</p>

<p class='c002'>My lying quiet, however, did not last long,
for I knew the loving merry welcome I should
have when, climbing&mdash;as I hoped and believed
quite unperceived&mdash;up the back of his arm-chair,
I should throw myself down into his lap with a
loud cry of joy, and then we should have a
famous game, until either he persuaded me to go
back to my blankets to await a rational hour for
getting up, or sent me up-stairs to be dressed.
These two things&mdash;the intent, absorbed purpose,
and the power of putting it aside to give
himself up completely, with simple delight, to
whatever he loved, whether to a child or to the
beauty of nature&mdash;are the two that seem to
me specially characteristic of him in all that
later part of his life which comes within my
remembrance.</p>
<div id='gertrude'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Dr Southwood Smith and his grandchild Gertrude.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_3'></a>At this time we lived in Kentish Town, then
field-surrounded, he going daily to his consulting-rooms
in Finsbury Square, returning late and
giving the early mornings and Sundays to public
work. These hours were at that period (1840 to
1842) chiefly devoted to the question of the employment
of children in coal-mines, the more
deeply impressed on me because the report
which he was then writing had illustrations
showing the terrible condition of people working
in mines.</p>

<p class='c002'>I remember long bright Sunday mornings when
he was at work endeavouring to remedy these
evils. He let me do what little I could, such as
the cutting out of extracts to be fastened on to
the MS. report with wafers&mdash;and very particular
I was as to the colour of these wafers! Sometimes
all I could do to help was to be quiet&mdash;not
the least hard work! Yet I loved these still
Sunday mornings, and would not willingly have
been shut out from them any more than from the
afternoon ride which came later, when, perched
up in front of him on his own horse, in the little
railed saddle he had devised for me, we rode
along the lanes towards Highgate. I can see
<a id='Page_4'></a>now the sunset light falling on the grass and
tree-stems of the Kentish Town fields as we
went along.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then came the day when the Act was brought
into operation which was to regulate the employment
of children in mines, and I tied blue ribbons
on to his carriage horses and thought, with a
child's hopefulness, that all the suffering was at
once and completely over. "Then, now, they are
all running over the green fields," I said.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather let me think it, and did not
damp my enthusiasm by letting me know that
this happy state of things was not arrived at in
one day!</p>

<p class='c002'>But although he often played merrily with me
and entered into my childish joys, my grandfather
was endowed with a most earnest nature
and with a firmness of character which was very
remarkable. He never swerved from a purpose,
never vacillated. One of his sayings was, "Life
is not long enough for us to reconsider our
decisions."</p>

<p class='c002'>It was probably this quiet determination, combined
with his unfailing gentleness, that made him
inspire so much confidence in his patients. I can
<a id='Page_5'></a>fancy, in a house where illness was spreading
anxiety and sorrow, the restfulness there would
be in his calm presence, and I can remember the
faces of those&mdash;often the very poor&mdash;who used to
come up to him wishing to thank him for the life
of some wife, or son, or child which they said he
had saved. These things used to happen in
the crowded city streets or courts, and sometimes
in parts of London far away from the place
where the illness had occurred. The fact that
these faces were generally forgotten by him,
whilst <i>his</i> was so well remembered, made a still
more beautiful mystery over it. It seemed to me
that there was an honour in belonging to one who
was a help and support to so many. Such experiences
must be familiar to those who share his
profession, still I mention it as being my strong
childish impression; and even now, looking
back upon his life, it appears to me that he
did possess, in a very high degree, not only
the power of healing, but that of soothing
mental suffering.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was, in fact, this deep sympathy, joined to
his remarkable insight into the relations between
effects and their causes, which led him to devote
<a id='Page_6'></a>his life to the promotion of sanitary reform, when
once it had become obvious to him that all effort
to improve the condition of the people would be
impossible until its principles were known and
acted upon.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_7'></a>
  <h2 id='chap01' class='c005'>CHAPTER I. <br /> EARLY LIFE, 1788-1820.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Thomas Southwood Smith was born at Martock
in Somersetshire in 1788, and was intended by
his family to become a minister in the body of
Calvinistic dissenters to which they belonged.
He was educated with that view at the Baptist
College in Bristol, where he went in 1802, being
then fourteen years of age. A scholarship, entitled
the "Broadmead Benefaction," was granted
to him, and he held it for nearly five years.</p>

<p class='c002'>But in the course of his earnest reading on
religious subjects he was led to conclusions opposed
in many ways to the doctrines he would
be expected to teach; and when, in the autumn
of 1807, from conscientious scruples, he felt bound
to declare this to be the case, the benefaction was
withdrawn. If we consider his youth and his
<a id='Page_8'></a>limited means, it is clear that this avowal must
have cost him no little anguish. He was at this
time only eighteen. It was an early age at which
to have been able to make up his mind on questions
so momentous, to break away from early
and dear traditions, and to face the displeasure
of the Principal of the college, Dr Ryland, whom
he ever revered. But honour demanded the
sacrifice, and it was made.</p>

<p class='c002'>In consequence his family cast him off at once
and for ever.</p>

<p class='c002'>During his college career, however, he had
visited much at the house of Mr Read, a large
manufacturer in Bristol, who was a man of noble
character, and at that time one of the leading
supporters of the college; and an attachment had
sprung up between the young student and Mr
Read's daughter Anne. This lady seems to have
possessed both great personal beauty and much
sweetness and strength of character; and though
she in nowise changed her own religious opinions,
she yet sympathised deeply with him in his earnest
seeking after truth, and encouraged him to risk
all&mdash;position, friends, everything&mdash;rather than act
against his conscience.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_9'></a>Mr Read also upheld him through all his difficulties,
and in the following year sanctioned their
marriage, which brought with it some few very
happy years. Two children were born&mdash;Caroline,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
my mother, and a year afterwards her sister
Emily.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>His happiness was to be but of short duration,
for in 1812 the young wife died, and left him
alone, at the age of only twenty-four, with two
little children. With what deep grief he mourned
her death his early writings show, but he met it
with a noble courage and an undiminished faith.</p>

<p class='c002'>The course he took was a strong one. Deprived
of the profession to which he had looked
forward, cut off from all intercourse with his
family, and having lost the wife he so devotedly
loved, he resolved&mdash;leaving his two children
under the gentle care of their mother's relations&mdash;to
apply himself to the study of medicine. Thus
he entered as a student at the Edinburgh University
in the year 1813.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_10'></a>At first he lived quite alone; but finding it more
than he could bear, he returned to England to
fetch his eldest child, then four years old.</p>

<p class='c002'>The father and child (my mother) went from
Bristol to Edinburgh in a small sailing vessel,
and encountered a terrible storm, which lasted
many days. She tells me that she still remembers
that storm of eighty-five years ago, the thick
darkness, the war of the winds, the toss of the
waves, the flash of the lightning illuminating her
father's face; but, most of all, she remembers the
feeling of the strong arm round her, giving the
sense of safety.</p>

<p class='c002'>His interest in religious matters at this period
was greater than ever; for the change in his
opinions, in leading him to take a more loving
view of the Divine nature, had increased his
ardour for the truth, and his own personal sorrow
had heightened his faith and made him wish to
carry its comfort to others. As well, therefore,
as pursuing his medical studies, he gathered round
him in Edinburgh a little congregation for service
every Sunday. The sermons preached by him
then, seem to have an added depth of feeling
when we know the circumstances in which they
<a id='Page_11'></a>were given; and the following words, written by
him at this time, give some insight into the calm
sublime faith which upheld him, not only then,
but throughout life.</p>

<p class='c002'>"Can there be a more exalted pleasure," he
writes, "than that which the mind experiences
when, in moments of reflective solitude&mdash;in those
moments when it becomes tranquil and disposed
to appreciate the real value of objects&mdash;it dwells
upon the thought that there is, seated on the
throne of the universe, a Being whose eye never
slumbers nor sleeps, and who is perfect in power,
wisdom, and goodness? How little can the
storms of life assail <i>his</i> soul who rests his happiness
upon this Rock of Ages! How little can
death itself appal <i>his</i> mind who feels that he is
conducted to the tomb by the hand of the
Sovereign of the universe! Yes! there is a
reality in religion; and if that happiness, which
is so often sought, and so often sought in vain&mdash;that
happiness which is worthy of a rational being,
and which at once satisfies and exalts him&mdash;be
ever tasted upon earth, it is by him who thus, in
the solitude of his heart, delights to contemplate
the idea of a presiding Benignity, the extent of
<a id='Page_12'></a>whose dominion is without limit, and the duration
of whose kingdom is without end! It is a felicity
which our Father sometimes sends down to the
heart that is worthy of it, to give it a foretaste of
its eternal portion."</p>

<p class='c002'>Much interest was felt in the young pale student
and his little girl. For all this time my mother,
the little Caroline, lived with him, cheering his
home-coming from the university to their rooms,
and drinking in from him at a very early age&mdash;as
I, her daughter, was destined to do many years
after&mdash;lessons of self-devotion to great ends.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was at this time of sorrow, and in the
intervals of medical study, that he wrote his
'Illustrations of the Divine Government,' the
object of which is to show how perfect is the
Love that rules the world, in spite of that which
seems to clash,&mdash;pain, and sorrow, and wrong&mdash;all
that we call evil.</p>

<p class='c002'>His medical studies only added to his impression
of the great Whole as one perfect scheme,
for he felt an intimate connection between the
field of scientific research and those religious
studies to which he had formerly devoted himself
exclusively. This is shown in his own
<a id='Page_13'></a>words in the preface to the fourth edition of
the work, which was published in 1844.</p>

<p class='c002'>"The contemplation," he writes, "of the
wonderful processes which constitute life,&mdash;the
exquisite mechanism (as far as that mechanism
can be traced) by which they are performed&mdash;the
surprising adjustments and harmonies by
which, in a creature like man, such diverse and
opposite actions are brought into relation with
each other and made to work in subserviency
and co-operation;&mdash;and the divine object of
all&mdash;the communication of sensation and intelligence
as the inlets and instruments of happiness&mdash;afforded
the highest satisfaction to my
mind. But this beautiful world, into whose
workings my eye now searched, presented itself
to my view as a demonstration that the
Creative Power is infinite in goodness, and
seemed to afford, as if from the essential elements
and profoundest depths of nature, a proof
of His love."</p>

<p class='c002'>This book came to be a help to many of all
classes and creeds, and passed through several
editions.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was often urged to reprint it in later life,
<a id='Page_14'></a>but held it back, wishing to modify it slightly.
Not that his opinion of its main principles had
altered in the least degree, but that he thought
he had passed too lightly over the sea of misery
and crime that there is in the world; he thought
there was rather too much of the bright hopefulness
of youth about it. Sorrow he had known,
certainly, in the loss of his wife; but the sorrow
that comes from the loss of one who was noble
and good, and who has been taken from us by
death, is of quite a different kind from that which
comes from a closer acquaintance with the mass
of sin and misery which exists. He did not
change his view that, even this, rightly understood,
is consistent with the divine benevolence;
but he wished to recognise more fully its existence,
and to enter more largely into the subject.</p>

<p class='c002'>Having completed his medical studies and
obtained his degree, the young physician determined
to take a practice in Yeovil. The
following extract from a letter, dated August
5, 1816, addressed by him to a friend in
Rome,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> shows with what views as to his future
profession he quitted Scotland.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_15'></a>"I leave Edinburgh this week," he writes;
"I leave it with much regret, for I have found
friends here whom I shall ever remember with
respect, affection, and gratitude. I go to Yeovil,
a little town in the west of England, where
it is my intention to take charge of a congregation
and at the same time to practise
medicine. This double capacity of physician
to body and soul does not appear to me to be
incompatible, but how the plan will succeed can
be determined only by the test of experience.</p>

<p class='c002'>"My expectations are not very sanguine, but
neither are my desires ambitious."</p>

<p class='c002'>"The test of experience" proved that he was
admirably qualified for the double office he had
taken upon himself, and for some years he pursued
faithfully the plan he had made.</p>

<p class='c002'>But this quiet country life was not to be his
always. It was decreed that he should come
up to London and enter into its teeming life,
to think, and write, and labour, until he had
done his part towards lessening its mass of
misery.</p>

  <h2 id='chap02' class='c005'>CHAPTER II. <br /> FIRST YEARS IN LONDON-DAWN OF THE SCIENCE OF MODERN HYGIENE, 1820-1834.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>On first arriving in London in 1820, my grandfather,
who whilst still at Yeovil had married
for the second time (Mary, daughter of Mr John
Christie of Hackney),<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> settled in Trinity Square,
near the Tower. He soon formed a considerable
private practice, and was appointed physician to
the London Fever Hospital, and he was thus
led to give very special attention to the subject
of fever. He also held the offices of physician
to the Eastern Dispensary and to the Jews'
Hospital, situated in the very heart of Whitechapel.
And while his experience in the wards
of the fever hospital taught him by what means
that disease can most frequently be <i>cured</i>, his
acquaintance with it in the homes of his East-end
<a id='Page_17'></a>patients taught him more&mdash;how it might be
<i>prevented</i>.</p>

<p class='c002'>Almost the first writings bearing on what came
to be afterwards called the "Sanitary Question"
are to be found in the pages of the 'Westminster
Review.' In the two first numbers of that Review,
published in the year 1825, there appeared some
articles on "Contagion and Sanitary Laws." These
articles, published anonymously, were written by
Dr Southwood Smith. It must be noted that
the word "sanitary" had not then the meaning
it has in these days: sanitary science was unknown,
and the words "Sanitary Laws" had a
no wider signification than that of the regulations
of a quarantine code.</p>

<p class='c002'>But from that time these words acquired a new
meaning.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the articles above referred to, facts were
brought together which had been collected from
the writings of men who had devoted years to
the study of pestilences in Spain, in various ports
of the Mediterranean, in Constantinople, and in
the West Indies. They had gone where epidemics
were raging, had risked their lives that
they might increase the store of knowledge about
<a id='Page_18'></a>these fearful scourges, and might, if possible, learn
on what they depend. Amongst these men, one
of the most distinguished was apparently a Dr
Maclean, of whom the article tells us that "when
he was in Spain in 1821 yellow fever attacked
Barcelona, and that with his wonted zeal he
hastened to the spot in order that he might fully
investigate its nature." Dr Maclean is spoken
of as "one of those extraordinary men who is
capable of concentrating all the faculties of his
mind, and of devoting the best years of his life,
to the accomplishment of one great and benevolent
object." We are told how, "in order to
demonstrate what epidemic diseases really are,
and what they are not, and to put an end to
errors which have so long and so universally
prevailed on this subject, errors which he believes
to be the source of incalculable misery and of
certain death to millions of the human race, Dr
Maclean, with an energy scarcely to be paralleled,
has devoted thirty years&mdash;a large portion of the
active life of man. In this cause he has repeatedly
risked that life, and for its sake he has
encountered all sorts of suspicion and abuse."<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_19'></a>Generalising, then, from the facts which such
men had collected and from others observed by
himself, Dr Southwood Smith endeavours to
establish the laws of epidemic disease. In the
first place, he labours to prove that <i>epidemic</i>
diseases are not, in the strict sense of the word,
<i>contagious</i>, and that the laws which epidemic
diseases observe offer a complete contrast to
those which regulate contagious diseases.</p>

<p class='c002'>"It was proved," he thought, to use his own
words, "that the symptoms of epidemic diseases
are not determinate and uniform. They vary in
different countries and different seasons&mdash;even in
the same country and the same season, and do
not succeed each other in any determinate order.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That epidemics observe certain seasons&mdash;the
periods at which they commence, decline, and
cease, hardly vary. For instance, the plague in
Egypt begins in March or April, and ends in
June or July. All epidemics in Great Britain, of
which we have any record, have raged in the
autumn.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That epidemic diseases prevail most in
certain countries, in certain districts, in certain
towns, and in certain parts of the same town.
<a id='Page_20'></a>They prevail most in those countries which are
the least cultivated; in those districts which are
the most woody, the most exposed to particular
winds and to inundations; in those towns which
are placed in low and damp situations, and which
are unprotected from certain winds; in those
streets and houses, and even in those apartments
of the same house, which are the most low and
damp, the worst built, and the least sheltered.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That epidemics commence, spread, and cease
in a manner perfectly peculiar. They arise, for
example, in some particular quarter of a town,
and do not attack the other districts which happen
to be nearest it in regular succession, but break
out suddenly in the most distant and most opposite
directions. People are attacked, <i>not in proportion
as the inhabitants of the affected mix with
the inhabitants of the unaffected places, but in
proportion as the inhabitants of the unaffected
expose themselves to the air of the affected places</i>.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That the termination of epidemics is peculiar,
since they cease suddenly at the exact period
when the greatest number of persons is affected
by them, and when the greatest mortality prevails.
This fact is inexplicable under the supposition
<a id='Page_21'></a>that epidemics owe their spread from person to
person. To suppose that a disease which is
propagated by contagion can rapidly decline and
even suddenly cease, just when most persons are
affected and the mortality is greatest&mdash;that is,
when the contagious matter is proved to be in
its most active and malignant state&mdash;is utterly
absurd.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That epidemics attack the same person more
than once, and that relapses are frequent amongst
those suffering from them, whereas contagious
diseases seldom affect the same individual a
second time, and relapses are most uncommon."</p>

<p class='c002'>From all this it will be clear that the object
of these articles was to prove that all epidemics
have their origin in the bad sanitary conditions
(as we now say) of the places in which they
arise.</p>

<p class='c002'>It happened then, as very frequently happens
in all sciences when the time is ripe for a discovery,
that those working in different fields of
observation noticed, at the same period, the same
facts&mdash;some, as for example Dr Maclean, in their
posts of observation during the epidemics in distant
countries; Dr Southwood Smith in the fever-haunts
<a id='Page_22'></a>of London. But it remained for him,
collecting together all the experience and generalising
from it, to announce the law on which
they depend.</p>

<p class='c002'>Those who thus arrived at the great principle
of the connection between defective sanitary conditions
and disease, laid the foundation of Sanitary
Reform. That connection is an old truth
now,&mdash;one of those about which it is difficult
to realise that it could ever have been unknown
to the world; but in those days it was unknown
and unrecognised, and amongst the few who
began to recognise it, there were scarcely any
who saw to what wide practical results such
truths ought to lead.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather, however, saw that if the principle
were once established, not only would the
quarantine laws, at that time absurd and inefficacious,
be modified; not only would our merchant
ships be released from spending long
weary months in unhealthy ports, while their
crews were perhaps contracting, from their confinement,
the very diseases which they were
supposed to have brought with them from foreign
lands; not only would the poor sufferers from
<a id='Page_23'></a>plague and yellow fever cease to be imprisoned
in the poisoned districts whose air had just given
them the pestilence;&mdash;not only would these <i>false</i>
precautions cease, but the true ones would be
taken: the <i>causes</i> of disease would be removed;
and thus, wherever a knowledge of this law
spread and was acted on, disease and death
would diminish.</p>

<p class='c002'>Might not, he thought, something practical
be done <i>now</i> and <i>here</i> if these facts were once
generally known? Epidemics throughout follow
the same laws. Were not the very causes which
produce plague in Egypt operating now to produce
typhus fever in Bethnal Green and Whitechapel?
We might not be able to stop the pestilential,
moisture-laden wind that came down to Cairo
each year at the time of the inundation of the
Nile, but could we not do something towards
purifying that which crept into the rooms of our
own poor from undrained courts and stagnant
pools? Could we not, if people once believed
and acted on their belief, banish the yearly
epidemic fever from the back-streets of our
large towns?</p>

<p class='c002'>Dr Southwood Smith believed that this great
<a id='Page_24'></a>result would follow from the general acceptance
of the truth of the principle he had announced.
He gave his life to spreading the knowledge of it.</p>

<p class='c002'>By the articles in the 'Westminster Review'
something was done towards enlightening the
public mind, for I find that they attracted the
attention of leading men in and out of Parliament,
and were often referred to in the debates in both
Houses.</p>

<p class='c002'>Five years more of daily experience and constant
thought passed before his 'Treatise on
Fever' was published.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a> It entered fully into
all the phenomena of the disease and into the
question of its treatment. It added largely to
the knowledge of fever existing at that time, and
was welcomed by the medical profession. 'The
Medico-Chirurgical Review,' the highest authority
of that day, pronounced it to be "the best
work on Fever that ever flowed from the pen
of physician in any age or country." It was for
a long time the standard work on the subject
with which it dealt. The most important part of
the work, however, as might be expected, is that
which relates, not to the treatment of disease
<a id='Page_25'></a>(which has since his time much changed) but
to its <i>causes</i>. And here we find an elaboration of
the principles laid down five years before in his
articles in the 'Westminster Review.' Those
articles had been the result of a rapid glance
which had gone to the very root of things,
though when they were written their writer had
held his position at the Fever Hospital for one
year only, and had therefore not acquired the
large experience of fever which he subsequently
attained. But the five years that had passed
since they were written could not change&mdash;could
only strengthen&mdash;his conviction of the
truth of the principles which he had previously
expounded.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the 'Treatise on Fever,' as in the articles
just quoted, it is enforced upon us, that since
epidemics are everywhere the same, when they
reach our own country we must expect to find
conditions similar to those which produce pestilence
in foreign countries. He writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"<i>The room of a fever patient, in a small and
heated apartment of London, with no perflation of
fresh air, is perfectly analogous to a stagnant pool
<a id='Page_26'></a>in Ethiopia full of the bodies of dead locusts. The
poison generated in both cases is the same; the difference
is merely in the degree of its potency. Nature
with her burning sun, her stilled and pent-up
wind, her stagnant and teeming marsh, manufactures
plague on a large and fearful scale. Poverty
in her hut, covered with her rags, surrounded by
her filth, striving with all her might to keep out
the pure air and to increase the heat, imitates
Nature but too successfully; the process and the
product are the same, the only difference is in the
magnitude of the result. Penury and ignorance
can thus, at any time and in any place, create a
mortal plague.</i>"<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Dr Southwood Smith has been accused of
ignoring the fact that those suffering from fever
can communicate the disease to others&mdash;of "infection,"
as it is called. But he did not. He shows,
on the contrary, that the atmosphere of a room
such as that spoken of in the passage just quoted
must have the power of inducing fever in others
besides the patient. He even says that "the
poison formed by the exhalations given off from
the living bodies of those affected by fever is by
<a id='Page_27'></a>far the most potent febrile poison derived from
animal origin."</p>

<p class='c002'>Then, it might be asked, of what consequence
is it to insist on the disease being non-contagious?
If fever-patients can give fever to others, it is a
mere matter of words whether you choose to call
it "contagious" or "infectious."</p>

<p class='c002'>It is, however, of the utmost consequence to
fix the attention on the difference; because, if that
is done, the real seat of the danger will be clearly
seen, and those whose duty it is to enter the
rooms of the sick will know that their danger
rarely lies in touching the patient, and may be
prevented by abundance of fresh air and scrupulous
cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c002'>In order to emphasise this side of the truth
my grandfather wrote as follows (and, though
it may seem to require qualification, the <i>general</i>
truth of his remark will be admitted by all): "No
fever produced by contamination of the air can be
communicated to others in a pure air&mdash;there
never was an instance of such communication."</p>

<p class='c002'>The form of poison given off from a fever
patient is, besides, not so much to be feared
as other forms of that poison, because, though
<a id='Page_28'></a>it is potent, it has not a wide range; when
let out into the fresh air, it is so far diluted
that its power is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p class='c002'>An epidemic, he asserts, can only arise from
some cause sufficient to affect a whole district.
Continually we are brought back to observe this
universal cause of fevers; to see that, whether
in the sudden falling off of an army to half its
numbers, or in the prostration of a whole ship's
crew on approaching shore, or in the plague devastating
Cairo, this one source may be traced
as the true one. Bad air comes from the marsh
near which the army is stationed; bad air, poisoned
by decaying vegetation, comes off shore
to the ship; bad air enters the houses of Cairo.
We are shown that Cairo is the birthplace of the
plague, because it is a city crowded with a poor
population; because it is built with close and
narrow streets; because it is situated in the
midst of a sandy plain at the foot of a mountain,
which keeps off the wind, and is therefore
exposed to stifling heat; and, above all, because
it has a great canal which, though filled with
water at the inundation of the Nile, becomes
dry as the river gets lower, and thus emits an
<a id='Page_29'></a>intolerable smell from the mud and from the
offensive matter that is thrown into it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Besides being thus shown that, in all places
in which epidemics appear, some sanitary defect
may be found, we are shown that they come
back and back to the same places, and that, if
these defects are removed, the epidemics will
not return. So we are led on to the great idea
that they are <i>preventible</i>.</p>

<p class='c002'>The facts advanced to prove these principles
have not, of course, the wide range, the distinct
statistical exactness, of those which the further
progress of sanitary science has now enabled
people to bring forward; but it is very interesting
to see how all further advance has been
but a development of the principles brought
forward in this 'Treatise on Fever,' just as it
was itself but a development of those brought
forward five years before. Hardly any investigations
had yet been made, but the results
which research would bring to light are here
foreshadowed. Even the direction which such
research would take is indicated, for we are told,
at the end of the chapter which treats of the
"Causes of Fever," that&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_30'></a>"Further inquiries are necessary&mdash;such as,
whether the vegetable and animal poisons we

cause of fever;<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a> by what means its general

public streets and common sewers, in the state
of the soil over large districts of the country
as influenced by the mode of agriculture, drainage,
and so on, favour or check the origin and
propagation of this great curse of civilised, no
less than of uncivilised, man."</p>

<p class='c002'>Not a mere article or book contained the result
of such inquiries. They occupied the greater part
of his life, and that of many others. Their outcome
is the present state of sanitary knowledge.</p>

<p class='c002'>If some people think there was nothing new
in the view of epidemics insisted on in this
<a id='Page_31'></a>Treatise, they have only to see what was the
common opinion at that time amongst medical
men. A few shared the writer's opinions, but
the majority of English physicians then certainly
took quite the opposite view. When
Asiatic cholera first broke out in 1831, it was
of no avail that the physicians of Bengal had
declared unanimously that "the attempt to prevent
the introduction of cholera by a rigorous
quarantine had always and utterly failed"; it
was of no avail that the articles on "Quarantine
Laws" had, six years before, urged the
same truth; the London College of Physicians
issued, notwithstanding, a notification that, wherever
cholera appeared, the sick should be collected
together in houses, which should be
marked conspicuously <i>Sick</i>; and that, even
after the sufferers had been removed, and the
houses purified, <i>Caution</i> should be marked on
them. That the dead from cholera should be
buried in separate ground; that food to be delivered
at a house where any one was sick
should be placed outside, and only taken in
when the person who brought it had gone
away; and that no one who had communicated
<a id='Page_32'></a>with a cholera patient should, during twenty
days after, communicate with the healthy.</p>

<p class='c002'>If cholera resisted all these precautions, and
became fatal in the terrific way it had done in
other countries, the authorities announced "that
it might become necessary to draw a strong body
of troops or police round the affected places."</p>

<p class='c002'>This proclamation of the physicians of 1831
was published throughout the land in the form
of an Order of the King in Council. It might
have been more to the purpose to have cleansed
the affected town.</p>

<p class='c002'>"But," says Mr Howell,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a> "the strong good
sense of the public averted many of the mischiefs
which these scientific advisers would
have produced had their counsels been carried
into execution. The preventive measures, which
were eventually adopted by them, consisted in
prohibiting intercourse between one town and
another by sea, and permitting it by land: thus
communication between London and Edinburgh
by stage-coach was perfectly free and uninterrupted,
while communication between those
capitals by sea was prohibited with such rigour
<a id='Page_33'></a>that no interest, however powerful, could procure
an exemption! Francis Jeffrey&mdash;at this
time holding the high office of Lord Advocate
of Scotland, and whose influence from his personal
and official connections was very great&mdash;was
unable to obtain permission for his faithful
servant, in the last stage of dropsy, to go from
London to Leith by water, lest he should carry
with him to his native country by that mode of
conveyance, not the dropsy which he had, but
the cholera which he had not.</p>

<p class='c002'>"'You will be sorry,' writes Jeffrey to Miss
Cockburn, 'to hear that poor old Fergus is so
ill that I fear he will die very soon. I have
made great efforts to get him shipped off to
Scotland, where he wishes much to go; but
the <i>quarantine regulations are so absurdly severe
that, in spite of all my influence with the Privy
Council, I have not been able to get a passage
for him, and he is quite unable to travel by
land</i>.... He has decided water in the chest
and swelling in all his limbs. The doctors say he
may die any day, and that it is scarcely possible
he can recover.'"<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_34'></a>Mr Howell adds that these examples are not
adduced for the purpose of casting obloquy on
the eminent physicians of that day, who vainly
endeavoured to reduce to practice in the nineteenth
century the standard, but obsolete, doctrines
taught almost universally in the medical
schools, but solely for the purpose of displaying
the state of the science of Public Health in the
year 1831-32, as far as the physicians of highest
reputation and largest practice may be taken as
its exponents.</p>

<p class='c002'>It need hardly be said that it is with this
purpose only that these facts are again cited
here.</p>

  <h2 id='chap03' class='c005'>CHAPTER III. <br /> LONDON CONTINUED&mdash;LITERARY AND OTHER WORK, 1820-1834.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The 'Treatise on Fever' held an important place
in the development of that sanitary ideal to the
realisation of which my grandfather afterwards
devoted himself almost exclusively; but in the
course of the years which are treated of in this
chapter, he wrote much on other subjects.</p>

<p class='c002'>During this time severe money losses had
necessitated the breaking up of the establishment
in Trinity Square; retrenchment became
a duty; Mrs Southwood Smith went abroad with
the three children of the second marriage<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> to
carry on their education; and (his two elder
daughters, Caroline and Emily, being engaged
<a id='Page_36'></a>in teaching away from home) my grandfather
once more retired to a strictly studious and professional
life at his consulting-rooms in New Broad
Street, giving much time to literary work, including
the writing of a large number of physiological
articles for the 'Penny Encyclopdia.'</p>

<p class='c002'>Dr Southwood Smith at this period assisted in
founding the 'Westminster Review.' This Review,
supported as it was by men of great ability
and earnest thought, took, as is well known, a
leading place in the promotion of the political and
social reforms of the day.</p>

<p class='c002'>His own contributions to it were many. Besides
the articles on "Quarantine and Sanitary Laws"
already mentioned, the one on "Education," which
appeared in the first number, may be specially
referred to.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was also one calling attention to the
horrors arising from there being no proper provision
for supplying the anatomical schools with
the means of dissection, which led to very practical
results.</p>

<p class='c002'>"Body-snatching" is now an extinct crime.
Such was the name given to the practice of robbing
graves of the bodies of the dead in order
<a id='Page_37'></a>to sell them for the purpose of dissection. Such
practices were an outrage against all the feelings
which render the resting-places of the dead
hallowed spots. One can imagine the horror
which the friends of the newly interred must
have experienced in finding that their graves
had been violated during the night; and worse
still were the midnight scenes when the work
was interrupted by the police, and struggles
ensued.</p>

<p class='c002'>The men who carried on this trade were called
"resurrection-men": they were a depraved and
dangerous class, and if the state of things then
existing had caused no other evil than that of
educating such a class, it would still have been
worth much effort to get it remedied.</p>

<p class='c002'>Without bodies for dissection medical education
was impossible, and at that time there was
only one legal means by which they could be
obtained: those of executed criminals were made
over to the medical profession for the purpose of
dissection. But this source was, happily, even
then a scanty one. Until, therefore, some other
provision was made, the employment of "resurrection-men,"
though against the law, and in itself
<a id='Page_38'></a>revolting to the professors of anatomy, was a
necessity.</p>

<p class='c002'>The difficulty was an increasing one. The
wretched men whose trade it was to supply the
medical schools were punished with imprisonment
and heavy fines, and were, not unnaturally, regarded
with abhorrence by the mob&mdash;such abhorrence
that it was often difficult to protect them
from its fury when arrested. In Scotland, especially,
this popular feeling was so strong that disgraceful
outrages were committed against those
even <i>suspected</i> of being concerned in exhumation;
the churchyards were watched, and the obstacles
in obtaining subjects for the schools had become
so many that the students were fast deserting
them. Indeed throughout Great Britain it appeared
as if there would soon be a general desertion
of all the native schools, and that students
would go to Paris for the education they could
not get at home.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the article by Dr Southwood Smith which
first called public attention to these evils, he
points out, in a very striking manner, the paramount
necessity of a supply of subjects. He
reminds his readers of the wild theories of former
<a id='Page_39'></a>times when anatomical knowledge was not possessed,
and enforces on their attention the fact
that this knowledge can only be acquired, with
any degree of perfection, by means of dissection.
He further reminds them that no operation can
be performed without torture to the living, and
danger to life itself, by the hand of a surgeon
unpractised in dissection; and no clear judgment
formed by the physician on the diseases of the
human frame&mdash;diseases generally seated in organs
hidden from the eye&mdash;without a study of the
internal structure.</p>

<p class='c002'>After shortly passing over the evils of the
system then prevailing, which have just been
pointed out&mdash;evils which were then very generally
known&mdash;he suggests the remedy,&mdash;a very
simple one. It was, to cease to give the bodies
of executed criminals for anatomical purposes,
and thus in a measure to take off the stigma
on dissection; and then to appropriate to that
purpose the bodies of all those who die in hospitals
and workhouses <i>unclaimed by relatives</i>.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nothing was done for some time, till in 1828,
three years after this paper was written, there
came the horrible discovery that the difficulty
<a id='Page_40'></a>of obtaining subjects from the churchyards had
become so great that two men, Burke and Hare,
had resorted to murder to supply the need&mdash;the
temptation having been the large price to be
obtained for bodies.</p>

<p class='c002'>When things had come to this climax, legislative
attention was aroused. At this time the
article which had appeared in the 'Westminster
Review' was reprinted as a pamphlet, under the
title of 'The Use of the Dead to the Living.'
In this form it went through several editions, a
copy being presented to members of both Houses
of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c002'>The measures recommended in it were mainly
adopted by the Legislature, and have proved
completely successful.</p>

<p class='c002'>There is something at first sight sad in a plan
which lets anything that is painful in the thought
of such an appropriation of the bodies of the dead
fall exclusively on the poor. This did not fail to
suggest itself to my grandfather's mind. But it
is to the survivors alone that such pain comes,
and these friendless ones would have none left
to shrink from this use of their remains. Such
were to be chosen for the necessary purpose, not
<a id='Page_41'></a>because they were "poor," but because they were
"unclaimed." Neither was any pain arising from
this arrangement to be compared with that springing
from the forcible seizure of bodies in the old
times. Out of <i>that</i> arose, necessarily, scenes of
horror revolting to all sense of the respect due
to the dead; while their quiet removal from the
hospital to the anatomical school, to be followed,
after the necessary dissection, by their burial, is
widely different. It seemed, moreover, that the
interest of the poor specially demanded a widespread
anatomical knowledge in medical men,
since they, more than all others, suffered when
the means of gaining it were limited. "Poverty,
it is true," my grandfather writes, "is a misfortune;
poverty, it is true, has terror and pain
enough in itself. No legislature ought by any
act to increase its wretchedness; but the measure
here proposed is pregnant with good to the poor,
and would tend, more than can be estimated, to
lessen the misery of their condition. For it would
give knowledge to the lowest practitioners of the
medical art&mdash;that is, to persons who are at present
lamentably deficient, and into whose hands the
great bulk of the poor fall. And, after all, the
<a id='Page_42'></a>true question is, whether the surgeon shall be
allowed to gain knowledge by operating on the
bodies of the dead, or driven to obtain it by practising
on the bodies of the living. If the dead
bodies of the poor are not appropriated to this use,
their living bodies must be, and will be. The rich
will always have it in their power to select, for the
performance of an operation, the surgeon who has
signalised himself by success; but that surgeon, if
he has not obtained the dexterity which ensures
success by dissecting and operating on the bodies
of the dead, must have acquired it by making
them on the living bodies of the poor."</p>

<p class='c002'>It was said at the time by objectors that the
measure in question would deter patients from
entering the hospitals, and add terrors to workhouses,
but experience has proved that my grandfather
was right: the adoption of his plan has not
been found to have the slightest effect of the kind.</p>

<p class='c002'>In considering the work of this period of my
grandfather's life, I ought not to omit to mention
his lectures, which were full of the same earnestness
and originality that characterised all he did.
He was lecturer at the Webb Street School of
Anatomy, where he gave a course on "Forensic
<a id='Page_43'></a>Medicine," which made much impression at the
time. He gave also courses of popular lectures
on physiology at the London Institution and elsewhere.
To those at the London Institution ladies
were admitted&mdash;a permission unusual in those
times.</p>

<p class='c002'>One lecture, delivered on a very remarkable
occasion, must be mentioned here. My grandfather
was the friend and physician of Jeremy
Bentham, and was called upon, after his death,
to perform a duty which he had solemnly undertaken.
The venerable philosopher died in 1832
at the age of eighty-five, and by will desired that
his body should be used for the purposes of dissection.
He intrusted to Dr Southwood Smith,
in conjunction with two other friends, the task
of seeing this disposition properly fulfilled, trusting
that they would not be deterred by opposition
or obloquy.</p>

<p class='c002'>This disposition of his body was not a recent
act. By a will, dated as far back as 1769, it
was left, for the same purpose, to his friend Dr
Fordyce. The reason at that time assigned for
this is expressed by Bentham in the following
remarkable words:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_44'></a>"This my will and special request I make,
not out of affectation of singularity, but to the
intent and with the desire that mankind may
reap some small benefit by my decease, having
hitherto had small opportunities to contribute
thereto while living."</p>

<p class='c002'>By a memorandum affixed to this document
it is clear that it had undergone revision as
lately as two months before his death, and that
this part of it, originally made when he was
twenty-one, was again deliberately and solemnly
confirmed by him at eighty-five.</p>

<p class='c002'>In thus appropriating his remains to the service
of mankind, Bentham carried out, to the
last moment of his life, and even after his death,
his principle of "Utility."</p>

<p class='c002'>The subject of dissection was agitating the
public mind: the "Anatomy Bill" was not yet
passed, and the idea might well present itself to
a benevolent mind such as his, that to show a
thorough absence of horror or dislike to the idea
of being dissected after death would be a means
of lessening the prejudice which existed against it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Whatever may be thought of the "greatest
happiness principle" of this philosopher, it did
<a id='Page_45'></a>not cause him to lead a selfish or epicurean
life. The long calm expanse of eighty-five
years was filled with simple pleasures, with hard
work, and contained many sacrifices to the cause
of truth.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather bears his testimony to the
wonderful energy and self-devotion of Bentham
during his life in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"Bentham's object was no less a one than to
construct an all-comprehensive system of morals
and an all-comprehensive code of laws. For
the accomplishment of a work so prodigious he
put forth an energy commensurate to the end.
The extent of mental labour required for this
undertaking, and actually brought to it, is truly
extraordinary. Every day for nearly half a century
did he devote to it never less than eight
hours, often ten, and sometimes twelve."</p>

<p class='c002'>And now, when this busy life was stilled, my
grandfather was bound to carry out as fully as
possible Bentham's wish that in death too he
might be useful. He delivered the oration over
the body, in the Webb Street School of Anatomy,
on the evening of the <abbr title='ninth'>9th</abbr> of June 1832.
One who was there thus writes of it:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_46'></a>"None who were present can ever forget that
impressive scene. The room is small and circular,
with no windows, but a central skylight,
and was filled, with the exception of a class of
medical students and some eminent members of
that profession, by friends, disciples, and admirers
of the deceased philosopher, comprising many
men celebrated for literary talent, scientific research,
and political activity. The corpse was
on the table in the centre of the room, directly
under the light, clothed in a night-dress, with
only the head and hands exposed. There was
no rigidity in the features, but an expression of
placid dignity and benevolence. This was at
times rendered almost vital by the reflection of
the lightning playing over them; for a storm
arose just as the lecturer commenced, and the
profound silence in which he was listened to
was broken, and only broken, by loud peals of
thunder, which continued to roll at intervals
throughout the delivery of his most appropriate
and often affecting address. With the feelings
which touch the heart in the contemplation of
departed greatness, and in the presence of death,
there mingled a sense of the power which that
<a id='Page_47'></a>lifeless body seemed to be exercising in the conquest
of prejudice for the public good, thus cooperating
with the triumphs of the spirit by
which it had been animated. It was a worthy
close of the personal career of the great philosopher
and philanthropist. Never did corpse of
hero on the battle-field, with his martial cloak
around him, or funeral obsequies chanted by
stoled and mitred priests in Gothic aisles, excite
such emotions as the stern simplicity of that
hour in which the principle of utility triumphed
over the imagination and the heart."</p>

<p class='c002'>In the year 1834 my grandfather published
his book entitled 'The Philosophy of Health,'<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
the preparation of which had been a work of
great care, and had occupied much time for
several years before. This book, which was,
perhaps, the first attempt to bring the truths
of human physiology within the comprehension
of the general reader, achieved a marked success.
It was full of the clearness and force
which characterised all the writings of its author.
The strides of modern science have now, of
course, left its physiological teaching far behind,
<a id='Page_48'></a>but at the time it did original educational work
and added lustre to his name.</p>

<p class='c002'>His life in chambers must have been an arduous
one&mdash;first at 36 New Broad Street, afterwards
at 38 Finsbury Square,&mdash;his days given
up to his ever-increasing practice, his mornings
and evenings to writing: the amount achieved
was prodigious, and he allowed himself but little
relaxation.</p>

<p class='c002'>I may mention that it was at this time that
my grandfather first visited at the house of old
Mr Gillies, a city merchant of refined literary
tastes and the father of the two distinguished
women, Mary and Margaret Gillies (author and
artist), who afterwards became the friends for
life of himself, his wife, and daughters, and in
whose home he&mdash;and I with him&mdash;had rooms
in Kentish Town and afterwards at Highgate,
though he occupied for professional purposes
the rooms in the city to which I have before
referred.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_49'></a>
  <h2 id='chap04' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV. <br /> WORK ON THE FACTORY COMMISSION, 1833.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In the year 1833 it became clear that some
legal interference was necessary with regard to
Factories.</p>

<p class='c002'>In order to understand the abuses which existed
in factories in 1833, we must revert to
the system of employment at the end of the
last century and trace its gradual development.</p>

<p class='c002'>At that period all the spinning and weaving
of the country was domestic, the spinning being
carried on in farmhouses and scattered cottages
in rural places by the mothers and daughters
of the families, and the weaving by men working
in their own homes in towns and villages. This
peaceful state of things did not last beyond the
beginning of the present century. The "spinning-jenny"
and "power-loom" were invented,
<a id='Page_50'></a>and changes occurred. Large buildings were
now needed to carry on the work, and mills
and factories sprang up beside the streams of
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Lancashire,
these places being chosen because water was
required to turn the new machinery. The
water-wheel now did much of the work which
had formerly needed the strong arms of men,
but the small and nimble fingers of children
were henceforth called into play, as they were
found to be specially fitted for much of that
which remained to be done by hand. Thus
it came about that children's labour, in consequence
of its greater cheapness, was substituted
for that of grown people.</p>

<p class='c002'>In order to get a sufficient supply of children,
which the scanty population near the mills
could not afford, manufacturers applied to the
managers of the workhouses in London and
other large towns, for pauper children to be taken
as apprentices. Hundreds, it is said even thousands,
of children were thus taken away from
even the slight protection which the tender
mercies of the workhouse authorities of that
day might afford, and placed entirely in the
<a id='Page_51'></a>power of the master manufacturer, or, worse
still, of his overseer.</p>

<p class='c002'>The evils that resulted from this apprenticeship
system resembled those springing from
slavery. One writer<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a> says:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"There is abundant evidence on record, and
preserved in the recollection of some who still
live, to show that, in many of the manufacturing
districts, cruelties the most heartrending
were practised upon the unoffending and friendless
creatures who were thus consigned to the
care of the master manufacturers; that they
were harassed to the brink of death by excess
of labour, that they were flogged, fettered, and
tortured to the most exquisite refinements of
cruelty; that they were in many cases starved
to the bone whilst flogged to their work; and
that, in some instances, they were driven to
commit suicide to evade the cruelties of a world
where, though born into it so recently, their
happiest moments had been passed in the garb
and in the coercion of a workhouse. The
beautiful and romantic valleys of Derbyshire,
Lancashire, and Nottinghamshire, secluded from
<a id='Page_52'></a>the public eye, became the dismal solitudes of
torture and of many a murder."</p>

<p class='c002'>The Legislature interfered, and in 1802 passed
an Act for regulating factories and protecting
the apprentices employed in them. This Act
was brought in and carried by Sir Robert Peel,
the father of the statesman who repealed the
Corn Laws, and himself a large manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c002'>A further change in the history of manufacture,
however, occurred. The steam-engine
was invented, and when its power was applied
to manufacture, it was no longer necessary to
build factories where water-power was at hand;
they were henceforth principally established in
towns. Apprentices were now but little employed;
free, paid child-labour, here to be obtained
in abundance, was preferred by the mill-owners.
They had never wished for apprentices;
the charge of them had always entailed considerable
trouble; the responsibility was felt
heavily by conscientious masters, whilst the legal
restrictions of Sir Robert Peel's Act prevented
the avaricious and hard-hearted from profiting
by the abuses of the system. Apprenticeship
therefore died a natural death.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_53'></a>It might be thought that children employed
under the new plan, receiving wages and living
at home under the protection of their parents,
would suffer no hardships calling for legal restraint;
but representations having been made
to the Government that abuses had crept in,
a Royal Commission of inquiry was determined
upon in 1833.</p>

<p class='c002'>On this occasion Dr Southwood Smith was
appointed by the Government a member of
this Commission, conjointly with Mr Tooke and
Mr Edwin Chadwick.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Their first work was to send district commissioners
into the manufacturing regions to collect
evidence, and the results of those inquiries
were embodied in the general Report. My
grandfather took a deep interest in the subject,
for the evils disclosed by the inspection, if not
so great as they had been under the apprenticeship
system, were still sufficiently appalling: children,
some of them not more than five years
old, were obliged to work the same number of
<a id='Page_54'></a>hours as the adult operatives&mdash;twelve, fourteen,
or sixteen hours a-day&mdash;sometimes the whole
night; their health was thus often ruined for
life; neither time nor strength remained for education;
they were growing up totally ignorant;
and they were, besides, often unkindly treated.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is sad to see in the Report such words
as these, quoted from the children's lips: "I
am sick tired, especially in the winter nights."
"So tired when I leave the mill that I can
do nothing." "I feel so tired when I gang
home that I throw myself down, no caring what
I does." "So tired I am not able to set one
foot by the other." "Many a time I have been
so fatigued I could hardly take off my clothes
at night, or put them on in the morning. My
mother would be raging at me, because when
I sat down I could not get up again through
the house."</p>

<p class='c002'>As to their ruined health, such sentences as
these foretell it: "Many nights I do not get
a wink of sleep from the pain." "My knees
failed from the work." Or, "Severe pains would
come on, particularly in the morning."</p>

<p class='c002'>The evidence of the overseers and managers
<a id='Page_55'></a>is scarcely less strong than that of the little
sufferers themselves.</p>

<p class='c002'>One manager says: "I have known the children
hide themselves in the wool so that they
could not go home when the work was over.
I have seen six or eight fetched out of the
stove and beat out of the mill."</p>

<p class='c002'>Another says: "After the children from eight
to twelve years old had worked eight or nine
hours, they were nearly ready to faint: only
kept to their work by being spoken to, or by
a little chastisement to make them jump up.
I was sometimes obliged to chastise them when
they were almost fainting, and it hurt my feelings;
then they would spring up and work
pretty well for another hour; but the last two
or three hours were my hardest work, for they
then got so exhausted."</p>

<p class='c002'>And a third manager says: "I have seen
them fall asleep, and they were performing their
work with their hands, while they were asleep,
after the 'billy' had stopped and their work
was over."</p>

<p class='c002'>Two great objections were made to any legislative
limitation of the number of hours of children's
<a id='Page_56'></a>labour. One was, that it was impossible
to shorten their hours of work without also shortening
those of the adults, who could not go
on without them; the other, that it was wrong
to restrict the liberty of the subject.</p>

<p class='c002'>The first of these was, truly, a difficulty; but
if the evil was so very great, it appeared to
my grandfather and those acting with him that
some change <i>must</i> be made in the mode of
working, rather than overtax the children to
this extent. Relays of children must be obtained,
or grown-up workers must be substituted
as assistants.</p>

<p class='c002'>With regard to the second objection&mdash;that it
would be restricting the liberty of private individuals
if the law interfered&mdash;the Report shows
that children, at the age at which they suffered
these injuries, were not free agents, but were
let out to hire by their parents, by whom their
wages were appropriated, and who were easily
rendered callous to their children's wrongs by
a threat of dismissal, or a bribe of an additional
penny an hour of wage. If the law did not
step in to protect these unfortunate little ones
from parents whose selfishness and ignorance
<a id='Page_57'></a>was allowing them to grow up diseased and
benighted, where, argues the Report, was their
help to come from?</p>

<p class='c002'>The question as to whether it is right in
any instance for the Government to intervene
between parent and child, is now practically
settled by the many laws and enactments which
regulate children's education and hours of labour.
But in those days the idea of any restriction
of a parent's right over his child excited much
opposition. It was regarded by many people
as both impracticable and undesirable.</p>

<p class='c002'>The reformers, however, carried their point
and achieved success. That very year the Factory
Act passed, and the recommendations of
the Report were nearly all embodied in it. No
child was allowed to be employed at all under
eight years old; children between eight and
thirteen were only allowed to work six and a
half hours a-day; and all those employed were
obliged to attend school for three hours a-day.
Inspectors were appointed to see that the provisions
of the Act were fully carried out.</p>

<p class='c002'>Of course there was considerable indignation
on the part of the millowners, but many of
<a id='Page_58'></a>those who at first objected to the restrictions
were afterwards convinced of their utility, and
as time passed on this conviction spread amongst
all classes and gathered strength.</p>

<p class='c002'>The only modifications of the Act of 1833
which have been made since, have been mere
extensions of its principles. The regulations,
which at first applied to cotton, cloth, and silk
mills only, have been extended by subsequent
Acts to bleaching and dyeing works. Powers
have also been given to compel the fencing of
machinery, and to enforce other safeguards
against injury to the workpeople.</p>

<p class='c002'>Even after the Factory Commission had finished
its work, and had ceased to exist, my
grandfather continued to watch with interest the
results of what had been done. Five years
afterwards, the House of Commons having
ordered a Return showing the working of the
educational provisions of the Act, he went down
himself to various mills, and I find his copy
of the Return thickly pencilled with marginal
notes like the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"I visited this mill myself with a view to
examine the school." "The whole neighbourhood
<a id='Page_59'></a>was opposed to the direction of the mill.
They now consider it a great blessing." "The
children of the higher class of people are anxious
to get employment in the mills."</p>

<p class='c002'>It must have given him great delight to feel
that, as was said by a writer eleven years later&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"The present Act has led to an amelioration
of the treatment, and an improvement in the
physical and moral character, of the vast juvenile
population, such as was never before effected
by an Act of Parliament; while the benefits
resulting from it to all parties, the employers
no less than the employed, are not only rapidly
multiplying and extending, but are becoming
more and more the subjects of general acknowledgment
and gratulation. There is reason to
believe that the total number employed in factory
labour in the United Kingdom is little
short of 1,000,000.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a> In one district, not by
any means one of the largest, the number of
children attending school was increased from
200 to 2316."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_60'></a>
  <h2 id='chap05' class='c005'>CHAPTER V. <br /> RISE OF THE SANITARY MOVEMENT, 1837.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Perhaps the most necessary and the most tried
quality in a reformer is Patience. Notwithstanding
the publication of the 'Treatise on Fever'
in 1830, and the tribute paid by the scientific
world to its masterly exposition of the treatment
and causes of the disease, notwithstanding the
constant and ardent endeavours of the author
to propagate his views, yet seven long years
passed away before he was able to awaken
the apathy of the public and the authorities.</p>

<p class='c002'>Year after year went by, and the wards of
the Fever Hospital continued to be supplied
from the same districts, from the same courts
and lanes&mdash;even from the very same house&mdash;as
before. The preventible suffering, thus daily
brought before my grandfather's eyes, was a
<a id='Page_61'></a>daily reminder of the urgent need for help&mdash;of
the necessity for taking practical steps to diminish
it.</p>

<p class='c002'>In 1837 the opportunity came for pressing
forward in the cause. That year a frightful
epidemic fever broke out in London, arousing
general alarm, and demanding special inquiry.
The pressure on the poor-rates became excessive,
and my grandfather was appointed by the
Poor Law Commissioners to report on the
eastern districts of London, Drs Arnott and
Kay being appointed to other districts.</p>

<p class='c002'>The title of the Report presented by him
is at once striking. He called it, "Report on
the Physical Causes of Sickness and Mortality
to which the Poor are particularly exposed, <i>and
which are capable of prevention by Sanitary
Measures</i>." Its opening words are,&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"Some of the severest evils at present incident
to the condition of poverty, which have a
large share in inducing its high rate of sickness
and mortality, are the consequences of improvidence.
Such evils are capable of being remedied
only by bringing the poor under the influence of
the inducements to forethought and prudence.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_62'></a>"But there are evils of another class, more
general and powerful in their operation, which
can be avoided by no prudence, and removed
by no exertion, on the part of the poor. Among
the gravest, and at the same time the most
remediable, of these latter evils, is the exposure
to certain noxious agents generated and accumulated
in the localities in which the poor are
obliged to take up their abode, and to the pernicious
influence of which they are constantly,
and for the most part unconsciously, subjected.</p>

<p class='c002'>"It is the object of the present Report to
direct attention to the nature and extent of this
evil, and to show how important it is that its
mitigation, and, as far as may be found practicable,
its entire removal, should form a part
of every exertion that is made for improving
the physical condition of the poor."</p>

<p class='c002'>These words would seem to strike the key-note
of Sanitary Reform.</p>

<p class='c002'>In order to make the Report more full and
impressive, Dr Southwood Smith writes an exact
account of what he saw. He went personally
over the greater part of the Bethnal Green
and Whitechapel districts. "I traversed," he
<a id='Page_63'></a>says, "a circle of from six to seven miles in
extent. I wrote the account of the places I
am about to notice on the spot; I entered many
of the houses and examined their condition as
to cleanliness, ventilation, as well as the state
of the people themselves, who were at the time
labouring under fever."</p>

<p class='c002'>The descriptions that follow are too dreadful
to be dwelt upon in detail here. We are shown
individually the houses of Whitechapel: they
are piled storey above storey, and are teeming
with people; the streets, courts, and alleys are
so built that all current of air is blocked out,
and no measures whatever are taken to secure
cleanliness. We are shown Bethnal Green, flat,
low, damp, wasted. Here the houses are not so
closely packed&mdash;there are open spaces; but these
are for the most part undrained marshes, and the
air coming across them is poisonous rather than
life-giving. Straggling rows of rickety cottages
look out upon stagnant swamps; their miserable
gardens are scattered over with uncleared dust
and refuse of all kinds, and are surrounded
with black and overflowing ditches, to cross
which you must pass over rotting planks used
<a id='Page_64'></a>as bridges: there are houses which contain only
two rooms, the larger being 9 feet by 7 and
7 feet high, the smaller not able to contain an
ordinary-sized bed.</p>

<p class='c002'>If the house has more rooms, it probably contains
many families, and a state of overcrowding
is produced nearly as fatal as that which prevails
in the parts of London where the houses
stand more thickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>The picture comes vividly before us of the
dismal homes, with their melancholy gardens
where the pale children play by the black
ditches; their green damp walls; the rags
stuffed into the broken windows to keep out the
tainted outside air; and the crowds huddled
together breathing the suffocating air within
doors. It is easy to realise the hopeless efforts
of the poor inhabitants to fight against the dirt
and disease which all those efforts are powerless
to overcome!</p>

<p class='c002'>No wonder then, that, in the words of his
Report, we are told that "in many parts of
both these districts fever of a malignant kind
and fatal character is always more or less prevalent;
that in some streets it has recently prevailed
<a id='Page_65'></a>in <i>almost every house</i>; in some in <i>every
house</i>; and, in some few instances, in <i>every room
of every house</i>. Cases are recorded in which
every member of a family has been attacked
in succession, of whom, in every such case,
several have died: some whole families have
been swept away. Instances are detailed in
which there have been found, in one small room,
six persons lying ill of fever together: I have
myself seen this&mdash;four in one bed and two in
another."</p>

<p class='c002'>He once more enforces the preventibleness
of this dreadful state of things&mdash;how entirely
it was within the power of man to change it
by wise attention to the laws of health. He
points out parts of the districts which had always
remained comparatively healthy, and some, formerly
haunts of fever, where during the last
epidemic no single case had occurred, owing to
sanitary improvements.</p>

<p class='c002'>The necessity for providing in some way for
the airing of streets and courts in densely populated
neighbourhoods, by the knocking down
of houses or other expedients, is insisted upon.
Its difficulty is admitted, but still it is urged.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_66'></a>"Though it might seem a hopeless task," he
says, "to set about ventilating such districts
as Bethnal Green and Whitechapel, yet, if the
importance of the principle be duly appreciated
and the object be kept steadily in view, much
may be accomplished. In some of the worst
localities in these districts, at moderate expense,
means might be taken to introduce free currents
of air, where at present the air is perfectly
stagnant and stifling. Some of the improvements
recently made in the City of London
show to what extent it is possible to introduce
good ventilation into the heart of the most
densely populated part of the Metropolis."</p>

<p class='c002'>In this Report my grandfather also draws
attention to the state of the Workhouses. He
was writing to the Poor Law Commissioners,
and so he could efficiently bring under their
notice the state of those buildings.</p>

<p class='c002'>"From what I have observed I am satisfied,"
he says, "that many existing workhouses are
extremely deficient in space, ventilation, and
drainage."</p>

<p class='c002'>The overcrowding in the dormitories is especially
pointed out. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_67'></a>"In going over the Whitechapel Workhouse
I was struck with the statement of the fact that,
out of 104 children (girls) resident in that house,
89 have recently been attacked with fever. On
examining the dormitory in which these children
sleep, my wonder ceased. In a room 88 feet
long, 16-1/2 wide, and 7 feet high, with a sloping
roof rising to 10 feet, all these 104 children,
together with four women who have the charge
of them, sleep. The beds are close to each
other; in all the beds there are never less than
four children, in many five; the ventilation of
the room is most imperfect. Under such circumstances
the breaking out of fever is inevitable.</p>

<p class='c002'>"I was likewise struck with the pale and unhealthy
appearance of a number of children in
the Whitechapel Workhouse, in a room called
the 'Infant Nursery.' These children appear to
be from two to three years of age; they are
23 in number, they all sleep in one room, and
they seldom or never go out of this room either
for air or exercise. Several attempts have been
made to send these infants into the country, but a
majority of the Board of Guardians has hitherto
succeeded in resisting the proposition.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_68'></a>"In the Whitechapel Workhouse there are two
fever-wards: in the lower ward the beds are
much too close; two fever patients are placed
in each bed; the ventilation is most imperfect,
and the room is so close as to be dangerous to
all who enter it, as well as most injurious to the
sick."</p>

<p class='c002'>The Report mentions, in contrast, the case of
the Jews' Hospital, where he had been physician.
In that hospital, though at one time there had
been a yearly outbreak of fever, since the number
of beds in the dormitories had been reduced, and
several large ventilators had been put in, the evil
had entirely ceased. At the time he wrote eight
years had passed since the improvements, and
fever had not once returned as an epidemic.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c002'>After finishing this Report, my grandfather set
to work to obtain exact statistics as to fever in
other parts of London; and by the next year
(1839) tables had been compiled, which proved,
by a wider range of experience, the truths he had
again and again brought forward. Once more he
wrote a Report to the Poor Law Commissioners&mdash;of
whom Mr (afterwards Sir Edwin) Chadwick
<a id='Page_69'></a>was one&mdash;pointing out the facts which were
proved by these figures and the duty of acting
on them.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Such accounts as those given by the three
physicians appointed by the Poor Law Board to
inquire, could not pass unnoticed. The press, not
only in London but in all parts of England, took
up the subject. Public men began to be roused.</p>

<p class='c002'>At first the facts were doubted. It was difficult
to believe that such a dreadful state of things
<i>could</i> exist; but attention was awakened, and inquiry
followed.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Marquis of Normanby, then Secretary of
State for the Home Department, was much impressed
with what he had read, but he could
hardly conquer a belief that there must have
been some exaggeration. My grandfather took
him to see some of the places in Bethnal Green
and Whitechapel which the Report had described.
Lord Normanby was deeply moved, as every one
must have been who was brought to realise the
kind of dwellings which were all that these people
had for homes. "So far," he said, "from any
<a id='Page_70'></a>exaggeration having crept into the descriptions
which had been given, they had not conveyed
to my mind an adequate idea of the truth."</p>

<p class='c002'>Lord Ashley, too, always in the forefront to
relieve the sufferings of the poor, was taken by
my grandfather on two occasions to see these
regions personally; and from that time forth he
became one of the most ardent supporters of the
Sanitary Cause, working strenuously for it both
in and out of Parliament.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> In a letter to a
friend my grandfather writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'>"<span class='sc'>Finsbury Square</span>, 1841.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I have just returned from Whitechapel and
Bethnal Green, over which I have been taking
Lord Ashley and his brother, and I think they
have received an impression which will be lasting,
and which will stimulate them to exert themselves
for the removal of some of the evils which they
have witnessed."</p>

<p class='c011'>The Bishop of London had the honour of being
the first to bring the question before Parliament.
<a id='Page_71'></a>In an earnest and eloquent speech made in the
House of Lords during the session of 1839, he
moved for an extension of such inquiries as the
Poor Law Board had caused to be made in London,
to other towns in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c002'>It must have seemed to my grandfather a
glorious moment when the principles he had so
long advocated were for the first time recognised&mdash;when
the country began to hear with surprise
and shame of the existing state of things&mdash;and
when the suffering, which he felt so deeply,
seemed about to be relieved.</p>

<p class='c002'>The movement had now begun. Surely it
would go quickly, since the saving of thousands
of lives each year depended on its progress?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_72'></a>
  <h2 id='chap06' class='c005'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> PHILANTHROPIC AND MEDICAL WORK, 1840-1848.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>I have now arrived at the period of my grandfather's
life which comes within my own memory,
and which begins with the days described in the
Introduction when I used to watch him as he sat
at his writing in the early mornings. He had
taken me to live with him at three years old, and
from that time I was with him throughout his life.
If, in this chapter or elsewhere, I dwell on his care
and tenderness towards myself, it is only that it
may indicate the love he invariably showed to all
near and dear to him.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather, though losing no opportunity
of promoting the cause he had chiefly at heart&mdash;the
great sanitary cause&mdash;did not limit his public
work to it alone: he was at this time engaged in
reforming the state of coal-mines, being a member
<a id='Page_73'></a>of a Royal Commission&mdash;the "Children's Employment
Commission"&mdash;the chief object of whose
labours was to secure the abolition of child-labour
in mines. It has been mentioned that the Report
presented to Parliament by this Commission had
pictures: they were drawn on the spot at my
grandfather's instigation, and I believe I am right
in saying it was the only parliamentary report so
issued. The state of things in the mines was
sufficiently appalling. Children of tender years
were employed in opening and shutting little
gates in narrow passages of coal. They were
untaught, and seldom breathed the fresh air.
They were sometimes as young as five years
old (parents have been known to send them
even at four years old); they sat in small niches,
scooped out of the coal, for twelve hours at a
time, to watch the doors, and they were alone and
in the dark except when a "hurrier" with a
candle fastened to his forehead passed along, on
hands and knees, dragging a truck.</p>

<div id='coal'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Old woman carrying coal.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The suffering was not confined to children; it
was found that young girls, married women, and
aged and decrepit women were exposed to bearing
upon their backs burdens of coal weighing
<a id='Page_74'></a>from three-quarters of a <abbr title='hundredweight'>cwt.</abbr> to 3 <abbr title='hundredweight'>cwt.</abbr>; often to
carry these whilst wading in water up to the
ankles, sometimes up to the knees, or to carry
them from the bottom of the mine to the bank up
steep ladders; to go through the hard work of
hewing coal by the side of the men; to drag
trucks on all fours harnessed by chains; and that
the nature of their work, when hewing coal, constantly
obliged them to dispense with most of
their clothing.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Children at work.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The illustrations in the Report brought all
this before my childish imagination very vividly.
Perhaps they also, as the Commissioners hoped
they might do, caught the attention of busy
members of Parliament and learned lords who
might not have waded through a lengthy "blue-book"
to find the facts which these pictures
showed at a glance. The object of the Commissioners
was to put the facts strikingly, and in
this they succeeded.</p>

<div class='ic002'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Lord Ashley's Bill, based on this Report, encountered
great opposition, especially in the
House of Lords, many members of which were
large proprietors of mines, and in the course
of its passage through Parliament it was much
<a id='Page_75'></a>mutilated. Lord Ashley had hoped to prevent
any boy under thirteen from working in the
mines, but the age of exemption was lowered
to ten years old; and his attempt to prohibit
the employment of boys and old men in the
work of lowering the miners into the pit by
means of ropes was also defeated.</p>

<p class='c002'>Still, the main points were gained; for by
Lord Ashley's Bill, which passed in 1844 and
was founded on the labours of this and the Factory
Commission, not only was it enacted that
all <i>children</i> under ten should henceforth be prohibited
from working in mines, but that such
labour should also be illegal for girls of all ages
and for women.</p>

<p class='c002'>It may be worth noticing that the change in
the law did not at first give satisfaction to the
miners. The men considered it a great hardship
to be deprived of the earnings of their wives and
children, and the women themselves complained
sorely of being deprived of their work. But
time has proved the great benefits of the new
system. The men now earn nearly as much as
a man and his wife used to do, the presence
of the wife in the home causes it to be better
<a id='Page_76'></a>cared for, and the children are free to attend
school.</p>

<p class='c002'>The "Children's Employment Commission" instituted
a further inquiry into the state of young
people employed in branches of trade not as yet
brought under regulation. This second Report
of the Commission, on "Trades and Manufactures,"
related to the state of apprentices in the
South Staffordshire ironworks, and of young
workers in such trades as earthenware-making,
calico-printing, paper-making, &amp;c.; and although
nothing could be done for them at the time, the
regulations recommended in the Report have
since been adopted.</p>

<p class='c002'>These Inquiries&mdash;important and interesting as
they were&mdash;occupied only the hours which my
grandfather could spare from his professional
work as one of the chief consultants in cases of
fever, and a leading London physician.</p>

<p class='c002'>He went daily from our home in Kentish
Town to his rooms in the City, and often used to
take me with him as a little child. We usually
stopped first at the Fever Hospital, which was
then near King's Cross. The Great Northern
Railway Station stands now on its site, where I
<a id='Page_77'></a>used to sit in the carriage at its gate. His connection
with that Hospital was never broken (at
his death he had been one of its physicians for
nearly forty years), and he was, of course, much
interested in its re-erection when it was removed
to its present position in Liverpool Road, Islington.
The new building was made with wards
having no upper storeys; each ward had three
outer walls and a very high ceiling, thus ensuring
perfect ventilation; and there were many other
advantages of arrangement.</p>

<p class='c002'>But even the original hospital at King's Cross
was very carefully managed as to fresh air, and
my grandfather's implicit belief in his own doctrine
of non-contagion was proved by his more
than once taking me into the fever-wards, though,
when I was a child and therefore peculiarly susceptible,
he never would let me breathe the
tainted air of the courts and lanes of which he
fearlessly encountered the danger, not only in his
capacity as a physician, but when making his
early sanitary investigations.</p>

<p class='c002'>Three times in the course of his life he had
been stricken down with fever. In one of these
attacks his life had been despaired of, but medical
<a id='Page_78'></a>skill, aided by most careful nursing and by
his naturally strong constitution, at length conquered
the disease.</p>

<p class='c002'>After the visit to the hospital we went on into
the City to his consulting-rooms, which were first
at 36 New Broad Street, and afterwards at 38
Finsbury Square; and then came the morning
hours during which he saw patients there, and I
amused myself until he was ready for the afternoon
round. Then outdoor work again. Generally
the visits led us through crowded streets
where the carriage got blocked in amongst great
waggons or hemmed in near high warehouses;
but at times there came long drives to some
patient living more in the country at Hackney,
Dalston, Stoke Newington, or farther off still;
and then what a happy time I had with him,
sitting on his knee and asking endless questions!
It was worth many hours of waiting in the carriage,
outside doors, to have the times that came
between.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then there was the Eastern Dispensary and
Jews' Hospital practice, in connection with which
he daily went to see patients in their own poor
homes. How well I remember being left in the
<a id='Page_79'></a>carriage at the end of streets too narrow for it to
drive down. I used to amuse myself with looking
out at the people passing to and fro&mdash;children
without hats and bonnets; old-clothesmen with
their bags; orange-girls;&mdash;many dark faces
amongst the passers-by&mdash;Jews, as I was afterwards
told. I used to wonder at it all, and make
up stories about the people and guess on what
errands they were bent when entering their little
shops and doorways; and when tired of all this&mdash;for
I was still too small to see without kneeling
up on the seat to look out at the window&mdash;I
seated myself on the floor of the carriage and
was soon deeply engrossed in some book of
pictures or fairy tales, which my grandfather, in
the midst of all else, had thoughtfully put into
the pocket of the carriage for me to "find."</p>

<p class='c002'>Then I would climb up again and watch for
him. At last he would come! Down the dark,
narrow street, looking very grave, the reflection
of some scene just left still resting on his face.
Out of such thoughts&mdash;produced by such places&mdash;came
his afterwork.</p>

<p class='c002'>When he came to me, however, the sad
thoughts passed away, and he was ready to let
<a id='Page_80'></a>his happy nature come through to cheer his little
girl. He would practically work to relieve such
misery as he had seen&mdash;day and night&mdash;at
all cost&mdash;through all opposition,&mdash;but he would
also play merrily with his little grandchild, to
make joyous for her the homeward drive through
the evening air.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather was much interested at this
time in another effort of which I have not yet
spoken. It was the institution of a "Home in
Sickness" in London for those of the middle
classes who might be far from their own families,
or who, from some other cause, could not secure
favourable surroundings in times of illness. The
position of such people struck him as very desolate.
There were many with homes far away&mdash;clerks,
students, young men engaged in various
professions, governesses, and other ladies of
limited income&mdash;who might be seized with illness
under circumstances when a return to their
family was impossible; others who had no family
to which to return. It seemed to him that
chambers or lodgings which might be tolerably
convenient for people in health, were utterly
unsuited to give the requisite comforts when
<a id='Page_81'></a>illness came: the poorer classes had the hospitals,
but for this intermediate class there was no
provision.</p>

<p class='c002'>His plan was, therefore, to found an institution
into which, by subscribing a small sum annually,
members could secure a right to be received
when they were suffering from disease. They
would each have a separate room where an equal
temperature could be secured, well prepared diet,
superior nursing, the advantage of a medical
officer in the house who could be called in at any
moment, and the daily advice of skilled physicians
and surgeons specially appointed; or should the
patients prefer it, of their own medical advisers.
For this they were to pay two guineas
a-week during their residence, or less, should it be
found that such an establishment could be self-supporting
at a lower rate: that it should be
self-supporting was, he thought, essential.</p>

<p class='c002'>Such an institution was founded in 1840 under
very good auspices, and opened under the name
of "The Sanatorium" at Devonshire House,
York Gate, Regent's Park, in 1842. My grandfather
freely gave it his medical services, as well
as his influence and supervision, for some years.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_82'></a>The house stood in a garden in which there
were tall trees (with rooks in them), making a
cool green shade and shutting out all other
houses; whilst within doors the soft carpets and
general feeling of quiet and order gave a sense of
peace. The contrast on turning into that garden
from the "New Road"<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a> was striking. Quiet,
indeed, was one of the chief boons which the
Sanatorium could offer.</p>

<p class='c002'>Charles Dickens, one of its earliest supporters,
speaks forcibly of this contrast in a speech made
in behalf of the Institution. He speaks of the
noise of crowded streets and busy thoroughfares
as&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"That never-ceasing restlessness, that incessant
tread of feet wearing the rough stones smooth and
glossy." "Is it not a wonder," he says,&mdash;"is it
not a wonder, how the dwellers in narrow ways
can bear it? Think of a sick man in such a place
as St Martins Court, listening to the footsteps,
and in the midst of pain and weariness obliged,
despite himself (as though it were a task he must
perform), to detect the child's step from the man's;
the slipshod beggar from the hooded exquisite;
<a id='Page_83'></a>the lounging from the busy. Think of the hum
and noise always present to his senses, and of
the stream of life that will not stop, pouring on,
on, on, through all his restless dreams, as if he
were condemned to lie dead, but conscious, in a
noisy churchyard, and had no hope of rest for
centuries to come."</p>

<p class='c002'>After some time it was found that a building
specially constructed, which should contain many
small separate rooms, would be more suitable and
less expensive than Devonshire House. To erect
this it was necessary to raise a building fund. By
this time the Institution was supported by a
powerful list of patrons, with Prince Albert at
their head; many large banking-houses and City
firms had subscribed to it for the sake of their
clerks and others; and more than a hundred
members of the medical profession had visited
it, and had signed a statement expressing their
belief in the need of such an establishment, adding
that the Sanatorium had supplied this need
most satisfactorily, though on a small scale.</p>

<p class='c002'>Charles Dickens then lived nearly opposite to
Devonshire House, and when the building fund
was opened, he and several other literary men
<a id='Page_84'></a>and artists came forward and gave for its benefit
the first of those amateur performances which
they repeated at a later period. They acted Ben
Jonson's "Every Man in his Humour," at St
James's Theatre, on November 15, 1845, both
audience and actors being brilliant. Charles
Dickens, Douglas Jerrold, John Foster, Mark
Lemon, Frank Stone, and others took part. I
remember seeing them, as I peeped down from
a side-box.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Sanatorium did not, from a money point
of view, succeed; but it was, nevertheless, the
forerunner of all those "Home Hospitals" and
"Nursing Homes" which have since proved so
great a boon to the public. So that in this, also,
my grandfather was a pioneer.</p>

<p class='c002'>As the name of Dickens has been mentioned, it
may be interesting to refer here to some of the
letters which show the early and keen interest
he felt in the removal of the evils with which
my grandfather was contending, and his readiness
to give his aid to the cause of the poor.
Here is the first letter, alluding both to the
Sanatorium and to the Children's Employment
Commission:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_85'></a>1 <span class='sc'>Devonshire Terrace, York Gate</span>,</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Fifteenth December 1840</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am greatly obliged to you
for your kind note and inclosure of to-day. I
had never seen the Sanatorium pamphlet, and
have been greatly pleased with it. The reasons
for such an Institution, and the advantages likely
to result from it, could not have been more
forcibly or eloquently put. I have read it twice
with extreme satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>You have given me hardly less pleasure by
sending me the Instructions of the Children's
Employment Commission, which seem to me to
have been devised in a most worthy spirit, and
to comprehend every point on which humanity
and forethought could have desired to lay stress.
The little book reaches me very opportunely; for
Lord Ashley sent me his speech on moving the
Commission only the day before yesterday; and
I could not forbear, in writing to him in acknowledgment
of its receipt, cursing the present system
and its fatal effects in keeping down thousands
upon thousands of God's images, with all my
heart and soul.</p>

<p class='c010'>It must be a great comfort and happiness to
<a id='Page_86'></a>you to be instrumental in bringing about so much
good. I am proud to be remembered by one
who is pursuing such ends, and heartily hope that
we shall know each other better.&mdash;My dear Sir,
faithfully yours,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another characteristic and genial letter, dated
half a-year later, appears to refer to some proposed
expedition, in the course of which Dickens
was to see on the spot some place where children
were at work in a coal-mine:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Devonshire Terrace</span>,<br />
<i>Wednesday, June the Second, 1841</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Dr Smith</span>,&mdash;I find it can't be done.
The artists, engravers, printers, and every one
engaged have so depended on my promises, and
so fashioned their engagements by them, that I
cannot with any regard to their comfort or convenience
leave town before the nineteenth. At
any other time I would have gone with you to
John-o'-Groat's for such a purpose; and I don't
thank you the less heartily for not being able to
go now.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you should see one place which you would
<a id='Page_87'></a>like me to behold of all others, and should find
that I could get easy access to it, tell me when
you come back, and I'll see it on my way to
Scotland, please God.</p>

<p class='c010'>I will send your papers home by hand tomorrow.&mdash;In
haste, believe me with true regards,
faithfully yours,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following year, Dickens, being about to
proceed to Cornwall, wrote to my grandfather
asking his advice as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Devonshire Terrace</span>,</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Saturday, October Twenty-second, 1842</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have an expedition afoot
in which I think you can assist me.</p>

<p class='c010'>I want to see the very dreariest and most
desolate portion of the sea-coast of Cornwall;
and start next Thursday, with a couple of friends,
for St Michael's Mount. Can you tell me of
your own knowledge, or through the information
of any of the Mining Sub-Commissioners, what
is the next best bleak and barren part? And
can you, furthermore, while I am in those regions,
help me down a mine?</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_88'></a>I ought to make many apologies for troubling
you, but somehow or other I don't&mdash;which is your
fault and not mine.&mdash;Always believe me faithfully
your friend,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>My grandfather's feeling about the Cornish
coast is given in his answer:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>36 New Broad Street</span>, <i>October 25, 1842</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I do not think you will find
St Michael's Mount particularly desolate, but it
is nevertheless a very remarkable and interesting
place. The coast about Land's End, I am told,
is incomparably more dreary and presents a fine
specimen of wrecken scenery. But the place
above all others for dreariness is Tintagel (King
Arthur's) Castle, near Camelford. There shall
you see nothing but bleak-looking rocks and an
everlastingly boisterous sea, both in much the
same state as when good King Arthur reigned.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
You must go through Truro to get to either
<a id='Page_89'></a>place. Your best plan will be to call on Dr
Charles Barham. He is the physician of those
parts and a most intelligent man, thoroughly acquainted
with every nook in Cornwall and known
to every mine. He was one of our best Sub-Commissioners;
and he will tell you where best
to go for your immediate object, and will take you
with the least loss of time to the best specimen
of a mine. But pray do not forget that a Cornish
mine is quite different from a coal-mine:
while much less disagreeable to the senses, far
more fatal in its effects upon the men and boys
(they have no women).</p>

<p class='c010'>I send you herewith a letter of introduction to
Dr Barham, whom you will find both able and
willing to give you all the information and assistance
you may require.&mdash;Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following merry letter from Dickens, on
his return, winds up the little correspondence:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>1 Devonshire Terrace</span>,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>York Gate</span>, <i>Eighth November 1842</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just come home from
Cornwall. I did not, after all, deliver your letter.
<a id='Page_90'></a>Having Stanfield and Maclise and another friend
with me, I determined not to do so, unless I
found it absolutely necessary; lest the unfortunate
Doctor should consider himself in a state
of siege.</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw all I wanted to see, and a noble coast
it is. I have sent your letter to Dr Barham
with a line or two from myself; and am as much
obliged to you as though I had driven him wild
with trouble.&mdash;Always faithfully yours,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before leaving this subject, I will give two
more of Charles Dickens's letters, which show
that the interest he had manifested in the first
beginning of the inquiry into the state of the
children in coal-pits did not wane, but that, when
the Report came before him in 1843, he was
deeply moved, and prepared himself at once to
take up arms in defence of the children. The
first letter runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Devonshire Terrace</span>, <i>Sixth March 1843</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Dr Smith</span>,&mdash;I sent a message across
the way to-day, urging you, in case you should
<a id='Page_91'></a>come to the Sanatorium, to call on me if convenient.
My reason was this:</p>

<p class='c010'>I am so perfectly stricken down by the blue-book
you have sent me, that I think (as soon
as I shall have done my month's work) of writing
and bringing out a very cheap pamphlet called
"An Appeal to the People of England on behalf
of the Poor Man's Child," with my name
attached, of course.</p>

<p class='c010'>I should be very glad to take counsel with you
in the matter, and to receive any suggestions
from you in reference to it. Suppose I were to
call on you one evening in the course of ten
days or so? What would be the most likely
hour to find you at home?&mdash;In haste, always
faithfully your friend,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next promises a "sledge-hammer" in lieu
of the pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Devonshire Terrace</span>, <i>Tenth March 1843</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Dr Smith</span>,&mdash;Don't be frightened
when I tell you that, since I wrote to you last,
reasons have presented themselves for deferring
the production of that pamphlet until the end
<a id='Page_92'></a>of the year. I am not at liberty to explain them
further just now; but <i>rest assured</i> that when you
know them, and see what I do, and where and how,
you will certainly feel that a sledge-hammer has
come down with twenty times the force&mdash;twenty
thousand times the force I could exert by following
out my first idea. Even so recently as
when I wrote to you the other day I had not
contemplated the means I shall now, please God,
use. But they have been suggested to me; and
I have girded myself for their seizure&mdash;as you
shall see in due time.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you will allow our <i>tte--tte</i> and projected
conversation on the subject still to come off, I will
write to you as soon as I see my way to the
end of my month's work.&mdash;Always faithfully
yours,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charles Dickens</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>I now turn to another subject. It was during
these years that my grandfather conceived
the idea that houses might be built from which
fever could be banished even amongst the classes
and in the districts in which up to that time
disease had most fatally prevailed. If the experiment
<a id='Page_93'></a>succeeded, and the amount of sickness
and death were found to be markedly diminished,
he felt that a very valuable practical illustration
would be afforded of the truth of the principles he
was advocating&mdash;of the law which connects bad
sanitary conditions with disease. He also hoped
it would be proved that money expended on the
building of such dwellings would bring in a fair
return of interest, so that it would be seen to
be a wise as well as a benevolent expenditure of
capital, and healthy dwellings might be multiplied.</p>

<p class='c002'>To accomplish this purpose he gathered together
the men who formed the original directors
of "The Metropolitan Association for Improving
the Dwellings of the Industrious
Classes" in 1843.</p>

<p class='c002'>As this was before the days of "limited liability,"
it was necessary to obtain through the
Prime Minister a Royal Charter to secure those
who should furnish money for the experiment
against serious loss if it failed, and a deputation
(who chose my grandfather as spokesman)
waited on Sir Robert Peel on January
23, 1844, to ask him for this charter, which
was eventually cordially granted.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_94'></a>The course the promoters took resulted in
the building of the block of, so-called, "Model
Dwellings" in Old St Pancras Road, on a site
nearly opposite the Fever Hospital.</p>

<p class='c002'>Thus a first step was taken towards providing
healthy and cheap homes for the poor, and the results
realised the fullest hopes of the originators.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c002'>In 1844 we removed from Kentish Town
to our Highgate home. It was very beautifully
situated, the slopes of the West Hill lying
at the back, and the front looking over Caen
Wood. When we went there, not even the
present open park paling divided us from the
park: there were only a few moss-grown and
picturesque hurdles bordering the road between
us and it, and our lane was as quiet as if it
had been far in the real country. The life
was, indeed, like that of the country, and full
of pleasure to a child. We had cows; and
my longed-for and much-enjoyed pony in the
field; and chickens, and dogs, and a goat, and
pigs; a perfect orchard of wonderful apple-trees,
and a wealth of roses that I have never seen
equalled. In the summer came hay-making of
<a id='Page_95'></a>our own, and all this so near London that
half an hour's drive of our fast horse Ariel
took us to its centre. It was indeed inwardly
and outwardly a beautiful home, and it is <i>the</i>
one of my childhood which is fullest of recollections
of my grandfather.</p>

<p class='c002'>During all my early years he had, as it were,
<i>two</i> works going on&mdash;the profession which occupied
his days, and the work for the various
reforms, which occupied the early mornings and
the quiet Sundays alluded to in the Introduction.
But now, as the "ten years' struggle"
advanced, the necessity of attending committees
and of having interviews with public men,
whom he was interesting and bringing together,
made itself felt; and thus not only were the
early mornings, as hitherto, given up, but, as
the public health cause advanced, many hours
were given out of his professional time, and
he compressed that given to his practice as
much as possible. He worked enthusiastically,
and with unfailing energy, beginning to write
at four or five (sometimes even at three) o'clock
in the morning, and only returning home to
dinner about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_96'></a>Our "Hillside" was a peaceful and lovely
spot for him to come to after the day's work
in London, and he made the most of the hours
spent at home. It was his wish, and our habit,
during all possible weather to breakfast out in
the summer-house, which stood at the top of
that piece of Lord Mansfield's park which was
our field, so that he might carry the memory
of its pretty view, and the feeling of its fresh
morning air, into town with him. We dined
in the garden in a tent under trees and surrounded
by flower-beds, and had dessert in the
field, where the view of the wooded slopes in
the light of the setting sun gave much delight,
not only to ourselves, but to many of
the distinguished friends who frequently joined
us on those happy evenings. These hours
were indeed happy ones, whether in summer,
spent in the field out in the starlight, or in
winter, round his hospitable fire; for he liked
to have, and helped to make, happiness around
him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Sometimes he used to let me tell him the
story of my day&mdash;the wonderful doings of pony,
dog, or newly-hatched little yellow chickens.
<a id='Page_97'></a>And then he would tell us of his own work.
Each time that some onward step of importance
had been taken he told us about it, but
when things were uncertain, or depressing, he
seldom mentioned them. So that an advance
for the cause came generally with the pleasure
of a sudden surprise, but a defeat we only
surmised by seeing him unusually grave. He
was naturally extremely reserved; but as he
advanced in years his desire for sympathy
overcame this reticence in some degree, so that
he became ready to share his thoughts on all
deep subjects with others. He rarely spoke of
things merely personal, and there was an absence
of all littleness in his conversation which
was striking. A mixture of high thought with
simplicity of expression was characteristic of
him. I listened to all that passed, and with
a strange, vague, but gradually-increasing understanding,
I learned to watch for the success
of his different efforts.</p>

<p class='c002'>The days were over when the height of the
carriage-windows had been an obstacle to my
view out into the streets of Whitechapel in
our daily drives, but I was still a child at the
<a id='Page_98'></a>time of the first public meeting of the "Health
of Towns Association." To this day the look
of everything at that meeting is distinctly impressed
upon me: the platform; the empty
chairs upon it; the table and bottle of water;
the crowd round us, which were all new to me,
are remembered as vivid first impressions are.
And when, after waiting some time, a number
of men came in&mdash;many of them of great importance&mdash;and
I saw my grandfather amongst
them, how proud and glad I felt that his efforts
to interest others had been successful, and that
he now had all this strength on his side.</p>

<p class='c002'>I did not understand all that passed, but I
knew when the speakers praised him; and when
his speech came, towards the end of the meeting,
I felt the thrill of his voice, and liked all those
other people to hear it too&mdash;I liked them to feel
<i>what</i> he was.</p>

<p class='c002'>But stronger even than the pride in him was
the belief that people must be moved by the
truth that was being brought forward; for, even
more than himself, I loved his cause. He lost
himself in it, and I caught from him the desire,
above all else, for the progress of the thing itself.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_99'></a>It is pleasant to me now to see the words, only
partly understood then, in which the public men
with whom he worked expressed the feeling with
which he inspired them. "Benevolent," "earnest,"
"indefatigable,"&mdash;this is what they call him when
mentioning his name. Again and again he was
thanked in the House of Commons and House
of Lords for what he had done.</p>

<p class='c002'>"The country was indebted to Dr Southwood
Smith and Mr Slaney," says Sir Robert Harry
Inglis, <abbr class='spell'>M.P.</abbr>, "for its first knowledge of the real
condition of the poorer classes. Their unwearied
labours for the instruction of the Legislature and
the public on these subjects were unrewarded by
emolument or fame; though the value of their
services was beginning to be appreciated, and
they would be more highly estimated by posterity
than in their own day."</p>

<p class='c002'>And Mr Slaney himself says that "for the
powerful manner in which he had first described
the actual condition of the poor in their present
dwellings; for the clearness with which he had
shown that their most grievous sufferings were
adventitious and removable; and for the untiring
zeal with which he had continued to press these
<a id='Page_100'></a>truths on the attention of the Legislature and
the public, Dr Southwood Smith deserved the
gratitude of his country."</p>

<p class='c002'>In bringing in the first sanitary measure in
1841, Lord Normanby speaks of what Dr Southwood
Smith had "taught" him; and in 1847 the
same tone is still used.</p>

<p class='c002'>In bringing in the Health of Towns Bill in
1848, Lord Morpeth, then Home Secretary,
gracefully disclaims his own share in the work,
and alludes to my grandfather, amongst others,
when saying,&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"Several persons of very great accomplishment,
and, what is more to the purpose, of most
ardent benevolence, both in and out of this House,
have taken great pains, in a way which does
them infinite credit, to inform and excite the
public mind on this subject; and now, mainly by
the accident of my position, I find myself at the
last hour (as I trust it may prove to be) entering
upon the fruit of their labours and gleaning from
their stores."</p>

<p class='c002'>All they could say of his devotion to the cause
of the people and the saving of life was true.
Silently, almost unconsciously, and as the most
<a id='Page_101'></a>natural thing he could do, he pursued his point.
As far as unceasing labour could enable him, he
carried on both his professional and his public
work; but when it became a question between
private fortune and public good he never hesitated&mdash;he
steadily and persistently chose the
latter.</p>

  <h4 id='chap07' class='c012'>CHAPTER VII. <br /> THE TEN YEARS' STRUGGLE FOR SANITARY REFORM, 1838-1848.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It is not easy to convince a whole nation of the
truth of new principles, however closely they may
in reality affect its welfare; not easy to produce
a degree of conviction that shall lead to practical,
tangible results. The early workers in the public
movements, such as that for Sanitary Reform,
have first to spread such a knowledge of existing
evils as shall create a general feeling of the need
for improvement. They have to educate the
public until it believes in that need. And when
the <i>vis inertia</i> of ignorance and indifference is
overcome, they have to encounter the active opposition
of those whose interests are bound up
with the old abuses, and whose property would
be affected were the evil swept away. Even
<a id='Page_103'></a>when it is decided that something must be done
they have to bear a long time of waiting until it
is settled what that something is to be, for decision
is not easy when questions arise which
closely affect the property of a powerful class.</p>

<p class='c002'>From these causes arose the long delay which
occurred before any mitigation of the suffering
took place, and hence it was that the great feature
of the period was a succession of "Inquiries" and
of bills brought before Parliament and defeated.</p>

<p class='c002'>The first step in the House of Commons was
made in 1840, the year following that which has
just been spoken of as the one from which dates
the public beginning of the Sanitary movement,
when Mr Slaney, <abbr class='spell'>M.P.</abbr> (one of the most earnest
and energetic of the early labourers in the cause)
obtained a Committee of the House to "inquire
into the sanitary state of large towns in England."
Mr Slaney wished not only to extend the investigation,
but to bring the striking results already
obtained directly before Parliament.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather was the first witness examined
by the Committee, and nearly the whole of his
evidence was transferred to its minutes. Some
of his words were&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_104'></a>"<i>These miseries will continue till the Government
will pass measures which shall remove
the sources of poison and disease from these
places. All this suffering might be averted.
These poor people are victims that are sacrificed.
The effect is the same as if twenty or
thirty thousand of them were annually taken
out of their wretched homes and put to death;
the only difference being that they are left in
them to die.</i>"</p>

<p class='c002'>And how long was it before any measure
to stop this could be carried through Parliament?
Dating from the time when he first
examined Bethnal Green and Whitechapel, <i>ten
years</i>. Not long, perhaps, in reality, considering
the difficulties in the way, but very long
to one who not only believed, but most deeply
felt and realised, the truth of such words as
those quoted above.</p>

<p class='c002'>The history of events was this. In 1841
Lord Normanby brought in a "Drainage of
Buildings Bill." It was by no means a perfect
one. My grandfather wrote of it many years
afterwards in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"Subsequent discussion and inquiry greatly
<a id='Page_105'></a>improved both the principles and the details of
sanitary legislation as compared with the proposals
in this bill. Still, honour to the House
of Lords who carried it with a cordial and
noble spirit through their own House and sent
it down to the Commons!"</p>

<p class='c002'>The session, however, came to an end before
any discussion could there be held on it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Next year, 1842, was presented Mr Edwin
Chadwick's Report on the Sanitary Condition of
the Labouring Population of Great Britain. He
was Secretary to the Poor Law Board, and
this Report was, in fact, a Return to the Bishop
of London's motion of 1839. It confirmed and
extended the results of previous inquiries, and
greatly helped to prepare the way for legislation.</p>

<p class='c002'>In 1843 Lord Normanby made a second attempt.
It was again defeated. The Administration
of which he was a member was broken up
before much progress had been made with the
new and improved bill which he had introduced.</p>

<p class='c002'>Now came another Inquiry. Sir Robert Peel's
Government, soon after coming into office, appointed
a Royal Commission,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a> of which the Duke
<a id='Page_106'></a>of Buccleuch was chairman, "to inquire into
the state of large towns and populous districts."
My grandfather was again the first witness examined.
Their report was presented in June
1844; but during this session no bill bearing
on sanitary subjects was even introduced.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather, however, who was brought
daily face to face with the preventible suffering,
was not likely to forget it, nor to relax his
efforts. With the calm, persistent earnestness
which was characteristic of him, he worked on
and on. The more defeats, the more necessity
for strenuous exertion.</p>

<p class='c002'>Seeing the difficulty of obtaining any practical
result from all the labour that had been devoted
to the improvement of the health of the people,
he now determined to try to bring together the
distinguished men who had taken an interest in
the cause, and who had exerted themselves to
promote it. He hoped that, thus united, they
would have more power in spreading the information
which had been acquired, and in forcing
it on the attention of the public and the Legislature;
and he also thought that a body of
men acquainted with the subject would be useful
<a id='Page_107'></a>in suggesting and discussing remedies, and in
proposing legislative measures.</p>

<p class='c002'>He succeeded in this effort. He founded the
"Health of Towns Association" already referred
to, which, numbering amongst its members
Lord Normanby, Lord Ashley, Lord Morpeth,
Lord Robert Grosvenor, Lord Ebrington,
Mr Slaney, <abbr class='spell'>M.P.</abbr>, and many other influential men
both in and out of Parliament, proved a highly
useful instrument in carrying forward the work
of Sanitary Reform up to the time of the passing
of the Public Health Act.</p>

<div id='meeting'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/meeting.png' alt='Meeting of Health of Towns Association.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Meeting of Health of Towns Association.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Its first meeting was held in December 1844,
and the facts which the various speakers eloquently
brought out are chiefly summed up in
the petition which, in accordance with one of
the resolutions then passed, was presented to
Parliament.</p>

<p class='c002'>Those to whom sanitary truths are familiar
will have little interest in this repetition of what
they already know, except as showing what the
early sanitary work was before a public opinion
had been formed. But it is somewhat curious
to look back upon a time when it was necessary
to state what now appear self-evident truths.
<a id='Page_108'></a>My grandfather gives it as the opinion of the
meeting, that&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"From the neglect of sewerage, drainage, a
due supply of water, air, and light to the interior
of houses, and an efficient system of house and
street cleansing, a poisonous atmosphere is engendered,
particularly in the districts occupied
by the poor, which endangers the health and life
of the whole community, but which is particularly
injurious to the industrious classes.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That it appears from indubitable evidence
that the amount of deaths attributable to these
causes is, in England alone, upwards of 40,000
annually.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>"That the great majority of the persons who
thus prematurely perish are between the ages of
<a id='Page_109'></a>twenty and forty, the period when they ought
to be most capable of labour and are heads of
families; and that it appears from official returns
that in some districts nearly one-third of the
poor-rates are expended in the maintenance of
destitute widows and orphans rendered destitute
by the premature death of adult males: that the
number of widows receiving out-relief was, in
the year 1844, 86,000; that these widows had
dependent upon them 111,000 orphan children;
and that there were, besides, receiving relief
in the Union houses, 18,000 orphan children.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That the expense thus constantly incurred
for the maintenance of the destitute would in
many cases defray the cost of putting the district
into a good sanitary condition, and thus prevent
the recurrence of these dreadful evils.</p>

<p class='c002'>"That this poisonous atmosphere, even when
not sufficient to destroy life, undermines the
strength, deteriorates the constitution, and renders
the labourer in a great degree unable to
work; and that there is every reason to believe
that his healthy life and working ability is
abridged in many districts to the extent of
twelve years. And lastly&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_110'></a>"That the moral and religious improvement of
the industrious classes is incompatible with such
a degree of physical degradation as is actually
prevalent in numerous instances; and that until
the dwellings of the poor are rendered capable
of affording the comforts of a home, the earnest
and best directed efforts of the schoolmaster and
clergyman must in a great degree be in vain."</p>

<p class='c002'>In 1845 the Government Commission issued
their second Report. Another bill, founded on
this and their former Report, was brought forward;
but it was so late in the year that it could
not be passed that session.</p>

<p class='c002'>Lord Lincoln, who brought it in, avowed that
his principal motive was that it might be considered
during the recess. "The Health of
Towns Association" was here very useful in
publishing a report (addressed in the first instance
to its own members) criticising the provisions of
this bill. My grandfather wrote this report,
assisted by the notes and suggestions of various
members, and by Mr Chadwick, who, though not
connected with the Association, helped greatly on
this and other occasions.</p>

<p class='c002'>Lord Lincoln's bill was not again introduced,
<a id='Page_111'></a>and the only sign of progress in these matters
during 1846 was to be found in the criticisms
offered on that abortive measure.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was at this juncture that it was thought well
to strengthen the hands of the Government by
bringing the force of Petition to bear upon the
Legislature. It thus became important to arouse
the attention of the working classes to the subject.</p>

<p class='c002'>My grandfather, as one move in this direction,
wrote the following address, which I give in full.
It was written from his heart, and, with all its
calm, philosophical mode of expression, burns
underneath with the white heat of that earnestness
which made this sanitary cause&mdash;this saving of
life and of suffering&mdash;with him almost a crusade.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>An Address to the Working Classes of
the United Kingdom on their Duty
in the Present State of the Sanitary
Question.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My Fellow-Countrymen</span>,</p>

<p class='c010'>The artificial distinctions by which
the people of a country are divided into different
classes have no relation to the capacities and
<a id='Page_112'></a>endowments of our common nature. No class
is higher or better than another in the sense of
having more or different sentient, intellectual,
moral, and religious faculties. Every property
by which the human being is distinguished from
the other creatures of the earth is possessed alike
by rich and poor. Wealth can give to the rich
man no additional powers of this kind, nor can
poverty deprive the poor man of one of them.
Before these glorious gifts with which our common
nature is endowed, with which all human
beings without distinction are enriched, and which
can be neither added to nor taken away, the little
distinctions of man's creation sink into absolute
insignificance.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the universal possession of these noble
faculties by the human race that makes the gift
of human life alike a boon to all. It is the exercise
of these noble faculties on objects appropriate
to them, and worthy of them, that <i>makes</i>
life a boon. It is because these faculties, when
duly exercised and properly directed, strengthen
and enlarge with time, that the value of life
increases with its duration. In the mere possession
of the full number of the years that make
<a id='Page_113'></a>up the natural term of life there is a larger and
higher boon than is apparent at first view. What
the natural term of human life may be is indeed
altogether unknown; because, although one of
the characteristics by which man is distinguished
from other animals is, that he is capable of understanding
the conditions of his existence, and of
exerting, within a certain limit, a control over
them, so as to be able materially to shorten or to
prolong the actual duration of his life,&mdash;yet these
conditions have hitherto been so little regarded
that there is not a single example on record of a
community in which the conditions favourable to
life have been present and constant, and in which
the conditions unfavourable to it have been excluded,
in as complete a degree as is obviously
practicable. History is full of instances in which
the successive generations of a people have been
swept away with extraordinary rapidity; but on
no page is there to be found the notice of a single
nation, in ancient or modern times, the great mass
of the population of which has attained a higher
longevity; yet it is certain that a degree of longevity
never yet witnessed has always been attainable,
because such longevity depends on conditions
<a id='Page_114'></a>which are now known&mdash;conditions entirely
within human control.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have said that there is involved in the mere
length of life a larger and higher boon than is
apparent without reflection. First, because length
of life is in general a tolerably accurate measure
of the amount of health, without a good share of
which life is comparatively worthless. The instances
are rare in which a person attains to old
age who has not enjoyed at least a moderate
share of daily health and vigour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Secondly, because length of life is a perfectly
accurate measure of the amount of enjoyment.
Long life is incompatible with a condition of
constant privation and wretchedness. It is one
of the beneficences of the constitution of our
nature that when the balance of happiness is
against us, a limit is fixed to our misery by its
rapid termination in the insensibility of death.
In the very brevity of its existence, therefore,
a human being indicates his own history for evil;
the shortness of his life is the sure and correct
index of the amount of his suffering, physical and
mental: it is the result, the sum-total, the aggregate
expression, of the ills endured.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_115'></a>Thirdly, because length of life is the protraction
of that portion of life, and only of that portion of
it, in which the human being is capable of the
greatest degree of usefulness. I have elsewhere
shown that every year by which the term of
human life is extended is really added to the
period of mature age; the period when the organs
of the body have attained their full growth and
put forth their full strength; when the physical
organisation has acquired its utmost perfection;
when the senses, the feelings, the emotions, the
passions, the affections are in the highest degree
acute, intense, and varied; when the intellectual
faculties, completely unfolded and developed, carry
on their operations with the greatest vigour, soundness,
and continuity: in a word, when the individual
is capable of communicating, as well as
of receiving, the largest amount of the highest
kind of happiness.</p>

<p class='c010'>These considerations give peculiar interest to
the results of the inquiries recently made into the
actual duration of life at the present time in our
cities, towns, and villages. From these inquiries
it appears not only that the rate of mortality in
the whole of England at the present day is deplorably
<a id='Page_116'></a>high, but that there is an extraordinary
excess of mortality over and above what is natural,
supposing the term at present attainable to
be the natural term of human life. The statement
of this excess presents to the mind an
appalling picture. From accurate calculations,
based on the observation of carefully recorded
facts, it is rendered certain that the annual
slaughter in England alone by causes that are
preventible, by causes that produce only one
disease&mdash;namely, typhus fever&mdash;is more than
double the loss sustained by the allied armies in
the battle of Waterloo; that 136 persons perish
every day in England alone whose lives might
be saved; that in one single city&mdash;namely, Manchester&mdash;thirteen
thousand three hundred and
sixty-two children have perished in seven years
over and above the mortality natural to mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>It appears, moreover, that the field in which
this annual slaughter takes place is always and
everywhere the locality in which you reside, and
that it is you and your wives and children who
are the victims. In some instances in the streets,
courts, and alleys in which you live, the mortality
which afflicts you is nearly double, and in others
<a id='Page_117'></a>it is quite double, that of the inhabitants of other
streets in the same district, and in adjoining districts.
While the average age at death of the
gentry and of professional persons and their
families is forty-four, the average age at death
attained by you and your families in many instances
is only twenty-two, just one-half,&mdash;that is
to say, comparing your condition with that of the
professional persons, you and your families are
deprived of one-half of your natural term of life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though the causes by which you and your
children are thus immolated are well known;
though they have been constantly proclaimed to
the public and the Government for nearly ten
years past; though their truth is universally
admitted; and though it is further admitted that
the causes in question are removable,&mdash;yet not
only has nothing whatever been done to remove
them, but their operation during this very year
has been far more fatal than at any period since
we have had the means of making accurate observations
on the subject. Thus we are informed
by the Registrar-General, that in the summer
quarter of the present year Ten Thousand Lives
have been destroyed, in a part only of England,
<a id='Page_118'></a>by causes which there is every reason to believe
may be removed; that in the succeeding quarter&mdash;namely,
the quarter ending the <abbr title='thirtieth'>30th</abbr> of September&mdash;the
number of deaths exceeded the number in
the corresponding quarter of last year by Fifteen
Thousand Two Hundred and Twenty-seven;
that is to say, in the very last quarter upwards
of 15,000 persons perished, in a part only of
England, beyond the mortality of the corresponding
quarter of last year.</p>

<p class='c010'>From this same report it appears, further, that
in many of our large towns and populous districts&mdash;that
is, in the places in which you in great
numbers carry on your daily toil&mdash;the mortality
has nearly doubled; in some it has quite doubled,
and in others it has actually more than doubled;
that this is the case among other places in
Sheffield and Birmingham; that in Sheffield, for
example, the number of deaths in the last quarter
are double those in the corresponding quarter of
last year and 149 over; while in Birmingham
they are double and 239 over.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The causes of this high mortality," says the
Registrar-General, "have been traced to crowded
lodgings, dirty dwellings, personal uncleanliness,
<a id='Page_119'></a>and the concentration of unhealthy emanations
from narrow streets without fresh air, water, or
sewerage."</p>

<p class='c010'>We are further told by the Registrar-General
that "the returns of the past quarter prove that
nothing effectual has been done to put a stop to
the disease, suffering, and death in which so many
thousands perish; that the improvements, chiefly
of a showy, superficial, outside character, have
not reached the homes and habits of the people;
and that the consequence is that thousands, not
only of the children, but of the men and women
themselves, perish of the diseases formerly so
fatal, for the same reason, in barracks, camps,
gaols, and ships."</p>

<p class='c010'>For every one of the lives of these 15,000
persons who have thus perished during the last
quarter, and who might have been saved by
human agency, those are responsible whose proper
office it is to interfere and endeavour to stay the
calamity&mdash;who have the power to save, but who
will not use it. But their apathy is an additional
reason why you should rouse yourselves, and
show that you will submit to this dreadful state
of things no longer. Let a voice come from your
<a id='Page_120'></a>streets, lanes, alleys, courts, workshops, and houses
that shall startle the ear of the public and command
the attention of the Legislature. The time
is auspicious for the effort; it is a case in which
it is right that you should take a part, in which
you are bound to take a part, in which your own
interests and the wellbeing of those most dear to
you require you to take a part. The Government
is disposed to espouse your cause; but
narrow, selfish, short-sighted interests will be
banded against you. Petition both Houses of
Parliament. Call upon the instructed and benevolent
men in the legislative body to sustain your
just claim to protection and assistance. Petition
Parliament to give you sewers; petition Parliament
to secure to you constant and abundant
supplies of water&mdash;supplies adequate to the unintermitting
and effectual cleansing both of your
sewers and streets; petition Parliament to remove&mdash;for
it is in the power of Parliament universally
and completely to remove&mdash;the sources of poison
that surround your dwellings, and that carry disease,
suffering, and death into your homes. Tell
them of the parish of St Margaret, in Leicester,
with a population of 22,000 persons, almost all of
<a id='Page_121'></a>whom are artisans, and where the average age
of death in the whole parish was during the year
1846 only eighteen years; tell them that on taking
the ages of death in the different <i>streets</i> in this
parish, it was found that in those streets that
were drained (and there was not a single street
in the place properly drained) the average age
of death was twenty-three and a-half years; that
in the streets that were partially drained it was
seventeen and a-half years; while in the streets
that were entirely undrained it was only thirteen
and a-half years.</p>

<p class='c010'>You cannot disclose to them the suffering you
have endured on your beds of sickness, and by
which your wives and children have been hurried
to their early graves&mdash;there is no column in the
tables of the Registrar-General which can show
that; but you can tell them that you know, and
you can remind them that they admit, that by
proper sanitary regulations the same duration of
life may be extended to you and your families
that is at present enjoyed by professional persons,
and that it is possible to obtain for the whole
of a town population at least such an average
duration of life as is already experienced in some
<a id='Page_122'></a>parts of it. In your workshops, in your clubs, in
your institutes, obtain signatures to your petitions:
get every labourer, every artisan, every tradesman
whom you can influence, to sign petitions. Other
things must also be done before your condition
can be rendered prosperous; but this must precede
every real improvement: the sources of the
poison that infects the atmosphere you breathe
must be dried up before you can be healthy, and
uncleanliness must be removed from the exterior
of your dwellings before you can find or make
a Home.&mdash;I am your friend and servant,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> January 1847.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>In this same year 1847 a Royal Commission&mdash;"Metropolitan
Sanitary Commission" (of which
my grandfather was a member)&mdash;was appointed
to inquire "whether any, and what, sanitary
measures were required for London."</p>

<p class='c002'>To the country at large, however, it seemed as
if perhaps there had been enough "inquiring."
The thing <i>had</i> been considered. Surely something
might be <i>done</i>; and Lord Morpeth now
brought forward a Government measure for
"improving the health of towns in England."</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_123'></a>In bringing in the bill, Lord Morpeth first
gives a history of the principal stages of the
various inquiries and commissions which had
been helped on by all parties, and by successive
Governments. He states that he has nothing
new to bring forward, and can but repeat the
information gained by others. He goes on to
show by elaborate statistics the waste of life in
large towns.</p>

<p class='c002'>"Thus the inhabitants of London," he sums
up, "compared with England at large, lose eight
years of their lives, of Liverpool nineteen. The
population of the large towns in England being
4,000,000, the annual loss is between 21,000 and
22,000."<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c007'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>But all places are not equally unhealthy, as
further statistics strikingly show. Where do we
find the greatest number of deaths? Is it where
wages are lowest and the people poorest? What
did Lord Morpeth tell the House?</p>

<p class='c002'>"Let it not be said," he urges, "that the
greater rate of mortality in certain districts is
owing to extreme poverty and the want of the
<a id='Page_124'></a>necessaries of life. The condition of the labourers
of the west, the lowness of their wages and the
consequent scantiness of their food and clothing,
have been the subject of public animadversion.
The mortality of the south-western district, which
includes Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, and
Wilts, is only 1 in 52&mdash;not 2 per cent; while that
of the north-western, including Cheshire and
Lancashire, is 1 in 37. With the exception of
the Cornish miners the condition of labourers
throughout the western counties is nearly the
same, yet in Wiltshire, the county of lowest
wages, the deaths are 1 in 49, in Lancashire
1 in 36. The average age at death in Wiltshire
was thirty-five, in Lancashire twenty-two. The
Wiltshire labourer's average age was thirty-five,
that of the Liverpool operative fifteen. At Manchester,
in 1836, the average consumption per head
of the population was 105 <abbr title='pounds'>lb.</abbr> of butcher's meat&mdash;about
2 <abbr title='pounds'>lb.</abbr> a-week (exclusive of bacon, pork,
fish, and poultry); the average age at death was
twenty years." He then brings forward evidence
of the preventibleness of most of the premature
deaths.</p>

<p class='c002'>Having proved the extent of the evil, Lord
<a id='Page_125'></a>Morpeth proceeded to show how it was proposed
to meet it,&mdash;by what machinery of central board,
inspectors, &amp;c; and, lastly, he entered into the
money-saving that would be effected were thorough
sanitary measures carried out. He cites Dr
Playfair's estimates, which give the money loss,
through unnecessary sickness and death, at
11,000,000 for England and Wales, and at
20,000,000 for the United Kingdom. This
loss arises from many causes: the expenses of
direct attendance on the sick; the loss of what
they would have earned; the loss caused by the
premature death of productive contributors to the
national wealth; and the expenses of premature
funerals.</p>

<p class='c002'>But the measure which was framed to relieve
this sum of misery, though well and carefully
prepared, was again to be thrown out!</p>

<p class='c002'>It was weary work. The years were passing
away, and nothing was being done. My grandfather
used to come home saddened by each
new defeat. He was sad at the delay, but he
was not disheartened; he knew that the thing
would be done in time, and that the progress
must be slow. He could wait calmly in that
<a id='Page_126'></a>belief and enjoy fully the beauty of the sunset
light during the summer evenings passed in our
beautiful field, overlooking the green slopes and
large trees of Caen Wood, Highgate. There our
friends used to come to us, amongst others Professor
Owen, Robert Browning, William and
Mary Howitt, and Hans Christian Andersen;
and we spent evenings that I can never forget,
staying out constantly till the moon rose or the
stars came out. How he loved nature and all
happy things!</p>

<p class='c002'>His faith did not err. The work of urging
had not been in vain; the movement could not
be stopped; the time was ripe.</p>

<p class='c002'>The bill had been thrown out in 1847, but in
1848 the first sanitary law, the Public Health
Act, passed!</p>

  <a id='Page_127'></a>
  <h2 id='chap08' class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII. <br /> OFFICIAL LIFE&mdash;GENERAL BOARD OF HEALTH, 1848-1854.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Immediately after the passing of the Public
Health Act, Lord Morpeth wrote to my grandfather
that the changes made in the bill during
its passage through Parliament had prevented
the creation of any post which could be offered
to him. Lord Morpeth said, however, that if
Dr Southwood Smith would give the department
the advantage both of his presence and counsel
by accepting a seat on the Board, he hoped
to provide for him a permanent post, by means
of a supplementary Act, "The Diseases Prevention
Act," which the Government expected
to pass shortly. In answer to this my grandfather
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_128'></a><span class='sc'>38 Finsbury Square</span>, <i>Sept. 12, 1848</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Lord Morpeth</span>,&mdash;I thank you very
sincerely for your kind communication....
Thanks to your Lordship's indefatigable exertions,
a position is now gained from which it
is possible to attack, with some hope of success,
the sources of excessive sickness and of premature
mortality. You have at last laid the
foundation of Practical Sanitary Improvement;
but the structure is still to be raised, and if,
as your Lordship intimates, both you and the
Government are desirous that I should assist
you in this labour, no one will apply himself
with a deeper feeling of responsibility, or with
greater earnestness, to what her Majesty justly
calls "this beneficent work."</p>

<p class='c010'>Your Lordship will remember how earnest
I was in December last, on the publication of
the Bishop of London's Pastoral Letter, that
we should at once avail ourselves of the power
of the Contagious Diseases Act; as well to
make immediate preparation against the threatened
visitation of cholera, as to check the progress
of our own native epidemics, then and
<a id='Page_129'></a>still so frightfully prevalent; diseases manifestly
dependent on conditions within our control, and
highly favourable to the spread of the pestilence
then menacing, and now still more nearly menacing
us. The Bishop of London had called
earnestly upon the clergymen of his diocese to
co-operate with the medical profession in this
object; and being desirous of ascertaining the
state of intelligence and feeling of this natural
class of co-operators in such a work, I visited
privately every clergyman in the Eastern District
of London and discussed the subject with
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without a single exception, I found them impressed
with a sense of the necessity of doing
something, and with a conviction that they might
materially help the medical profession in carrying
out any plan of operation proposed by
authority. The necessity of some such general
plan is greater now than it was then, on account
of the continual prevalence in their severest
forms of our own epidemics, and of the nearer
approach of cholera. The new "Contagious
Diseases Act," the "Public Health Act," and the
new "Metropolitan Sewers Act," taken together,
<a id='Page_130'></a>afford greater facilities for meeting this necessity
than ever before existed; and certainly it
is now in the power of the Government to do
more for securing the public health, and improving
the physical condition of the population,
than has ever yet been attempted in any age
or nation,&mdash;a power which, if wisely and successfully
exerted, will reflect the highest honour on
the Government and the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>My intimate relation with the origin and progress
of this work, and my deep conviction that
it is one of the most useful to which experience
and science can be applied, would render it a
satisfaction to me to spend the remainder of
my life in assisting to complete it.&mdash;I am, my
Lord, with much esteem and regard, very faithfully
yours,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dates given at the head of this chapter
(1848 to 1854) cover the period when the
Sanitary cause was completely successful, and
when my grandfather found himself one of the
heads of a Government department devoted to
the furtherance of sanitary measures throughout
the kingdom&mdash;a department which was called the
<a id='Page_131'></a>General Board of Health. Here, at offices in
Whitehall, in daily conference with Lord Ashley
(afterwards the Earl of Shaftesbury) and Mr
Edwin Chadwick, he could propagate knowledge
on questions relating to the public health, and
carry out sanitary measures, as from a powerful
centre, having the authority of a Government
department.</p>

<p class='c002'>This power of carrying out his convictions to
practical issues was an immense satisfaction to
my grandfather's mind, and many were the congratulations
which he received on this public
appointment. The following, from a Portsmouth
physician, is interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><i>October 8, 1848.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,&mdash;Though personally a stranger, permit
me to offer my sincere congratulations on your
appointment by her Majesty's Government to the
Board of Health, where the talents you have so
long displayed will have scope for the full share
of utility.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have traced and followed you in the various
publications issued by the Government and the
Health of Towns Association for several years
past, and having myself, though in a much more
<a id='Page_132'></a>confined area, mingled with public life, I know
the heart-burnings, the disappointments and
annoyances, to which in such a course a man is
necessarily exposed; but if reward come at last&mdash;though
the delay has almost made the heart sick&mdash;one
is then amply repaid, especially in a case
like yours, when a whole kingdom will applaud
the appointment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Permit me again, sir, to beg your acceptance
of my congratulations.&mdash;I am, sir, your obedient
servant,</p>

<p class='c010'>To Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>, Whitehall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost the first work which the Board of
Health had to do was to take measures to resist
an epidemic of Asiatic cholera. This it did by
sending down inspectors from London to instruct
and aid the local authorities in organising plans
for systematic cleansing, and for the removal of
the sick. The Board also issued "Notifications"
for the purpose of instructing the public as to
what precautions were necessary to avert an
attack. But above all, it organised, at my grandfather's
instance, what was called the "system of
house-to-house visitation." My grandfather was
<a id='Page_133'></a>of opinion that in every instance an attack of
cholera is preceded by a period of a few days
(sometimes only of a few hours) of premonitory
symptoms, which, since they are painless, escape
notice; and that, unless a specially appointed
medical visitor goes round to the houses of the
less educated to inquire, and almost to cross-question,
as to the existence of these symptoms,
and to treat the disease <i>at once</i>, this stage rapidly
passes on into developed cholera, when recovery
becomes all but hopeless. These facts and experiences
are brought out in the General Board
of Health's Report on the Cholera Epidemic of
1848-49, presented to Parliament in 1850.</p>

<p class='c002'>In relation to this, Lord Brougham thus wrote
to my grandfather:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'>"I also proclaimed<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c007'><sup>[23]</sup></a> your important statement
of the <i>preventive cure</i> of cholera, bearing further
testimony to the soundness of your views from
Sir <abbr class='spell'>J.</abbr> Mordaunt's account given to me in the
Malta case.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I availed myself of the opportunity to give
you just praise, and to note your many valuable
<a id='Page_134'></a>services to the country. Lord Lansdowne amply
concurred in the statement by his cheers. But
such things are never reported. Had you given
a vote or an opinion on a contested party matter,
all the papers would have chronicled your merits
and our eulogies of you.&mdash;Ever yours truly,</p>

<p class='c010'>"<span class='sc'><abbr class='spell'>H.</abbr> Brougham</span>."</p>

<p class='c011'>Another of the subjects which the Board of
Health took up was that of quarantine. Their first
report on that subject, issued in 1850, was considered
of sufficient importance to be translated
into various foreign languages, and was ordered
to be presented to the Parliaments of France and
Italy. I think that, even if recent discoveries
have modified some of the opinions there advanced,
all the progress which has been made
in the prevention of disease by quarantine regulations
has been in the direction there indicated&mdash;that
is, in plans for cleanliness, for the letting in
of light and air, and for the isolation of infected
persons in pure air, thus diluting the poison&mdash;rather
than in plans for shutting them into confined
quarters as was formerly done, thereby
concentrating the poison.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_135'></a>The question of putting a stop to burials in
overcrowded churchyards was also taken up by
the Board. Their report on "A General Scheme
for Extra-mural Sepulture" was published also in
the same year (1850), and proved very clearly
the evils arising from the crowded state of churchyards
at that time.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Board proposed that a Government department
should be established which should be
intrusted with the care of the whole question of
the burial of the dead; that, in future, interment
should take place only in ground remote from
large towns; and that everything should be arranged
decorously and reverently. My grandfather,
personally, was much interested in adding
an element of beauty in the form of exquisite and
appropriate cemetery churches and chapels. But
only the preventive part of the scheme was
carried out. What was actually achieved was
the closing of the overcrowded churchyards; the
provision of other grounds has been left for
private enterprise.</p>

<p class='c002'>Thus, for six years, earnest men, at the head
of a Health Department, spread information and
gave advice. The newspapers of the period contained
<a id='Page_136'></a>many notices of the various practical
measures devised by this department, together
with comments and leading articles on its reports
on such large and pressing questions as
cholera, quarantine, extra-mural sepulture, and
water-supply. The newspapers, indeed, began
to devote much space to the discussion of health
questions in all forms, so that at last a widespread
interest was aroused.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then came a time when the chief question was,
<i>not</i> as to the principles, but as to what machinery
could best be employed to carry out those principles.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fear of "centralisation," and the desire for
local self-government, which is strong in the
English people, caused opposition in Parliament
to the continuance of any Government department
having such large control over the expenditure
of public money on local objects; so that in
1854 the original Board of Health ceased to exist,
but did not cease till sanitary principles and
sanitary science, once unknown or despised, were
acknowledged throughout the country, and recognised
as one of the fundamental needs lying at
the root of all efforts to benefit the community.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_137'></a>With the ending of this department my grandfather's
official life came to a close. From a
personal point of view this cessation of his
public work was somewhat softened by the
following letter, written at the desire of the
Prime Minister:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Whitehall</span>, <i><abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr> August, 1854</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>&mdash;I am directed by Viscount Palmerston to
inform you that he cannot allow you to quit the
Board which this day ceases to exist by the expiration
of the Act of Parliament by which it was
constituted, without conveying to you the full
approbation of her Majesty's Government of the
zealous, able, and indefatigable manner in which
you have performed the important duties which
have belonged to your official situation; and his
Lordship desires me to express to you the great
regret which he feels, that an adverse decision
of the House of Commons as to an arrangement
which his Lordship had proposed for the reconstruction
of the Board of Health has led
to so abrupt a cessation of your employment.&mdash;I
am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Henry Fitzroy</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr <span class='sc'>Southwood Smith</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'><a id='Page_138'></a>According to the rules of the service, my grandfather
was not entitled to a retiring allowance,
because so much of the work he had done had
been unpaid. A few years afterwards, however,
a Government pension was awarded him in consideration
of the services which he had rendered
to the country.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_139'></a>
  <h2 id='chap09' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX. <br /> RETIREMENT FROM PUBLIC LIFE&mdash;ST GEORGE'S HILL, WEYBRIDGE, 1854-1860.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>When his official life came to a close, my grandfather
retired to a house on Weybridge Heath,
and he met the sudden cessation of his eager
public life with the same calm courage with which
he had met all the other crises in his career.</p>

<p class='c002'>This house had been built on a beautiful spot
as a gathering-place for his much-loved and somewhat
scattered family, and the beauty of its position
came to be a great comfort to him when he
turned his quiet days to the prosecution of literary
work in his little study, which, opening on to a
sunny terraced walk, overlooked, through vistas
of dark-green pines and yellow birch-trees,
the miles of blue distance which stretched out
southwards to the Surrey and Hampshire hills.
<a id='Page_140'></a>Through the kindness of Lord Ellesmere, whose
property adjoined, there was a small private gate
leading from our own little firwood on to St
George's Hill itself; and, in the intervals of his
writing, frequent strolls on to its beautiful slopes
were a great source of pleasure during that first
autumn and in all the ensuing years. The heather
banks and wooded dells brought him much joy;
for, as always, it was in the presence of nature
and in the stillness of the country that he gathered
strength. The strain of the last few months had
been great, and it was well that the closing of the
year brought with it the much-needed rest.</p>

<p class='c002'>He now gave a good deal of time to physiological
study, turning to his old subjects with the
vigour of a younger man, and entering with the
deepest interest into the discoveries of later
science. He did this with a view of bringing his
early book, 'The Philosophy of Health,' which at
the time of its publication had made so much
mark, up to the standard of modern knowledge;
and though he did not live to complete this task,
the reading for it gave a living interest to those
years of quiet country life.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had also much satisfaction in writing and
<a id='Page_141'></a>publishing a pamphlet called 'Results of Sanitary
Improvement,' based mainly on the experience
obtained in the "Model Dwellings" for the working
classes, of which he had been the originator.
This pamphlet, coming as it did before many
influential men throughout the country, spread
the good news of progress far and wide.</p>

<p class='c002'>A further instance of the fruit of his labours
was afforded him by his visit to Edinburgh,
in November 1855, when he lectured on his
own subject, "Epidemics," at the Philosophical
Institution, where a brilliant reception and distinguished
audience awaited him.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c007'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>I have a vivid recollection of his pleasure
in the beauty of Alnwick as we journeyed
north&mdash;of its old castle's warm grey walls, its
lovely woods and clear running streams, during
a sunny Sunday which we passed there,&mdash;the
gold and russet tints of autumn shining
out against a perfectly blue sky; and I also
remember the satisfaction he had in hearing
from the Mayor, who took us round the town,
<a id='Page_142'></a>of the pure water and good drainage lately
introduced. Alnwick was, I believe, one of the
first places which adopted the sanitary measures
advised by the General Board of Health,
so that here he had the gratification of seeing
some of the great reforms practically carried out.</p>

<p class='c002'>As I am recalling the various sources of comfort
which came to my grandfather during these
years at Weybridge, I must mention the great
happiness which arose from the opening out
of the lives of two of his granddaughters, Miranda
and Octavia Hill; for it was at this time
that they&mdash;at the ages of nineteen and sixteen&mdash;took
the responsibilities of their lives upon
themselves, and began the great and good works
which they have since carried to such wide
issues.</p>

<p class='c002'>In his retirement, letters of appreciation and
sympathy reached him from many of the public
men with whom he had worked, expressing in
various ways that which Lord Shaftesbury, who
knew him as well as any, gives as his own
feeling when writing to a mutual friend:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"I have known Dr Southwood Smith well,
having sat with him during four years and in
<a id='Page_143'></a>very trying times at the Board of Health. A
more able, diligent, zealous, and benevolent man
does not exist. No work ever seemed too much
for him if it were to do good. His great services
will not, I fear, be appreciated in this generation."</p>

<p class='c002'>Such words as these cannot but have been
gratifying to my grandfather; but in 1858 those
who shared these sentiments resolved to make
a clearer and more public demonstration of their
sense of the value of the services which he had
rendered to the country. At a preliminary meeting
held on the <abbr title='seventh'>7th</abbr> May 1856 it was agreed
that this recognition should take the form,
primarily, of a memorial bust, to be presented
to a suitable public institution. This intention
was communicated to Dr Southwood Smith at
the final meeting held at the house of Lord
Shaftesbury, 24 Grosvenor Square, on the 6th
of December 1858, and was accompanied by a
short address.</p>

<p class='c002'>I give his own words of thanks, as they show
not only the pleasure this recognition afforded
him, but also&mdash;what is so characteristic of him&mdash;his
joy in the progress of his cause, quite
apart from his personal share in it:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='Page_144'></a>"My Lord, I need not say how deeply I
feel the kindness that prompted the proceeding
which has led to this meeting. If anything could
increase the intensity of that feeling, it would
be the words in which you have given expression
to your sentiments in this matter, and to those
of the rest of the subscribers to this recognition.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The labourers in the work of sanitary reform
have been many; and it is by the united
efforts of some of the most enlightened, disinterested,
and learned men that shed lustre on
this century, that this great work has been placed
in its present position.</p>

<p class='c010'>"That such names as those which grace this
Tablet<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c007'><sup>[25]</sup></a> should have united to express their
sense of the value of any part which I may
have taken in this work, will ever be to me
a source, I do not say of happiness only, but
of that rare and pure happiness which results
not alone from the inward consciousness of devotion
to duty through encouragement and discouragement,
through evil and through good
report, but also from the knowledge that such
judges of the matter justify that consciousness,
<a id='Page_145'></a>and in my own individual case have so placed
their judgment on record, that it may be present
to me to the latest day of my life and to my
children and my children's children.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I will only add that the honourable names
on this Record give me this further delight,
that they are to me a pledge that Sanitary
Improvement will go on. They thus bear their
testimony to their sense of its importance, and
they, from their position and character, can
ensure its progress. The first labourers in this
work may not be permitted to complete it,&mdash;they
seldom are in any great work; but, whoever
may have the satisfaction of completing
it, that work&mdash;whatever obstacles may retard,
whatever short-sighted and short-lived interests
may oppose it, however it may seem for
a while not to advance&mdash;<i>that work will be
done</i>; and the time will come when not only
the professional man and the educator, but the
legislator, the statesman, the general, the minister
of religion&mdash;in a word, every one to whom
is entrusted the care, the guidance, and the
control of numbers, will feel ashamed to be
ignorant, and indeed will be accounted unfit
<a id='Page_146'></a>for his office if he be ignorant, of the laws
of human health and life."</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes! That his work had lived and would
live, this was what he cared for. This it was
that kept him uniformly brave and bright, and
made him say to me one evening in tones of
grateful joy&mdash;we were sitting on the wide balcony
watching the moon rise over the fir-tree tops,
his hand in mine as of old,&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"I have indeed succeeded! I have lived
to see seven millions of the public money expended
on this great cause. If any one had
told me, when I began, that this would be,
I should have considered it absolutely incredible."</p>

  <h2 id='chap10' class='c005'>CHAPTER X. <br /> THE SUNSET OF LIFE&mdash;ITALY, 1861.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>My grandfather had travelled abroad but little during
his strenuous life. He had, it is true, been to
Paris in 1850, accompanied by Mr Charles Macaulay,
Dr John Sutherland, and Mr (afterwards Sir
Henry) Rawlinson, on business connected with the
General Board of Health scheme for extra-mural
sepulture, but, except on that occasion, he had
not left England.</p>

<p class='c002'>So that when in 1857 he was asked to join
a party of three proceeding to Milan for the
purpose of examining the irrigation works of
that city, he gladly undertook the journey, which
was to lead them <i>vi</i> Marseilles and along the
Cornice Road, then traversed by carriage only.
The beauty of Italy thus came before him with
full freshness at the age of seventy, and he returned
strengthened and invigorated.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_148'></a>The following year my grandfather lost his
wife. She died at The Pines, at Weybridge,
after a short illness, in the summer of 1858.</p>

<p class='c002'>Two years later he was able to carry out his
cherished hope of returning to Italy, and we went
to Florence, where his daughter Emily had been
living for some years. She welcomed us to the
rooms she had secured in an old palace beyond
the Arno&mdash;to the artistic Italian surroundings
of which she had added something of the atmosphere
of an English home.</p>

<p class='c002'>His delight in the art and nature of Florence
and its environs was intense, and the beauty of
land and sky seems to make a fitting setting
for the end of such a life as his.</p>

<p class='c002'>He stood on the old jeweller's bridge, one
autumn evening late in November, and watched
the sun go down behind the western hill of the
rushing Arno; and the sunset of his own life
came soon after. Perhaps he had lingered too
long gazing at this beautiful scene; for a chill,
producing rapid bronchitis, took him from us on
the 10th December 1861.</p>

<p class='c002'>Towards the end, when he knew he was passing
away, after other gentle loving words, almost
his last were&mdash;with a sweet triumphant smile&mdash;"Draw
<a id='Page_149'></a>up the blind and let me see the stars;

<p class='c002'>At the cemetery at Porta Pinti are some

December morning and showed a sloping avenue
of marble tombs, tangles of pink and of white
China roses in full flower falling over them, and
at the end a tall white cross shining in the
sunlight against the blue Italian sky,&mdash;fit type
of the black gates of death, which had rolled
back to let him pass into the Eternal Light

  <h2 id='chap11' class='c005'>CHAPTER XI. <br /> THE AFTERGLOW.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It was at this time that the Prince Consort
died, and England was full of mourning. Lord
Shaftesbury speaks, in his diary of December
16, 1861, of that national loss, and then alludes
to the death of my grandfather in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c002'>"I hear, too, that my valued friend and coadjutor
in efforts for the sanitary improvement
of England is gone&mdash;the learned, warm-hearted,
highly-gifted Southwood Smith."</p>

<p class='c002'>But the work he had set on foot and the
principles he had established did not end with
his life. They have gone on with an ever-increasing
vitality to this day.</p>

<p class='c002'>The efforts he made for the non-employment
of women and young children in mines have
resulted in the entire cessation of the practice;
<a id='Page_154'></a>while his work for the provision of proper
schooling for factory children has culminated
now in a whole system of workhouse and factory
supervision and in the school-board system
throughout the land.</p>

<p class='c002'>Intramural burial is virtually at an end. And
the "Home Hospitals" and "Nursing Homes,"
which are established in all our large towns, are
the successors of that "Sanatorium, or Home
in Sickness," which he devised, and for which
Charles Dickens pleaded in its early days.</p>

<p class='c002'>The marshy Bethnal Green and Spitalfields,
where he first visited the individual homes,
and which he took Lord Normanby and Lord
Ashley to see, are now comparatively healthy
places. He found them without water; there
is now water laid on to every house. He found
them without drainage; now a complete and
scientific system of drainage exists throughout
the metropolis. The "7,000,000 of public
money spent on sanitary reform," over which
he rejoiced so greatly, is, since he spoke in 1857,
increased by all the millions spent on such works
in the last forty years.</p>

<p class='c002'>His first set of "Model Dwellings," in the
<a id='Page_155'></a>St Pancras Road, is now multiplied by the
countless blocks of such in all the large towns
of England. Sanitary Law and Sanitary Inspection
everywhere prevail, and the thousands
of lives annually saved&mdash;the lowered death-rate
both in town and country&mdash;attests the power
of the laws he was one of the first to perceive
and proclaim.</p>

<p class='c002'>To show the saving of life in London alone,
the death-rate in the early "forties" was 26 in
the thousand, it is now 19; whilst in the Model
Dwellings the improvement is even more striking,
since there it is not more than half that of
London at large. To show how completely the
experiment he made to prove the possible healthfulness
of such dwellings has answered, it is only
necessary to quote the figures given in the report
just issued for this fifty-third year of the
Society which he founded.</p>

<p class='c002'>"The rate of mortality," we learn, "in the
Dwellings of the Association, was 964 per 1000,
including 12 deaths which occurred in hospitals,
infirmaries, &amp;c. In the entire metropolis the
rate was 182 per 1000. As regards infant mortality,
the deaths under one year of age were
<a id='Page_156'></a>at the rate of 79 in every 1000 births; and in
the entire metropolis, at the rate of 161 per
1000 births."</p>

<p class='c002'>Allusion has been made to the bust which
was executed as a tribute to the public services
of my grandfather by those whom we have called
the Pioneers of Sanitary Reform&mdash;Lord Normanby,
Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Carlisle (formerly
Lord Morpeth), Charles Dickens, Mr
Slaney, and others. This bust is now in the
National Portrait Gallery, and accompanying it
are the following lines by Leigh Hunt, which
proclaim the services of his life in the cause
of the poor to wider circles still:&mdash;</p>

personal inspection of Bethnal Green and Whitechapel.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>289 Bethnal Green Road</span>, <i>Feb. 5, 1842</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>My dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;Lord Ashley, the Honorable Mr
Ashley, and yourself visited the following places with
me. I have arranged them in the form of a table: in
one column is the name of the street, and, opposite, a

by which his Lordship may recognise it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Apologising for the length of time that has elapsed
since I promised to forward this account to you, I
remain, dear Doctor, Your Obedient Servant,</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>T. Taylor</span>.</p>
<p class='c006'><a id='Page_160'></a><i>First Visit.</i></p>
<p class='c006'>Back of Chester Place.       Open ditch and several pigsties.</p>

<p class='c002'>Pitt Street.                 A wretched road, no drainage. Hon. Mr
Ashley spoke to one of the inhabitants
respecting the state of the road.</p>

<p class='c002'>Burnham Square.              Houses built on undrained ground.</p>

<p class='c002'>Grosvenor Street, Bonner Street.            Undrained houses on one side not supplied
with water (all the houses on
this estate, to the amount of about
200 or more, in the same condition,
the inhabitants having to go to a
distant pump or beg of their neighbours,
who have had it laid on at
their own expense, and who for giving
it are liable to punishment).
Bonner Street has an open ditch in
front of part of it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Pleasant Place.              Road a perfect quagmire.</p>

<p class='c002'>Green Street.                Stagnant water on southern side and
also on part of the northern.</p>

<p class='c002'>Baker Street, Digby Street.                Houses back to back, consisting of two
rooms, each one above the other.
Privies close to windows of lower
rooms. Baker's night-yard is in this
street.</p>

<p class='c002'>James Street.                Another night-yard.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bethnal Green Road (eastern end).           No drainage, many of the houses having
10 inches to 2 feet of water in the
cellars, which are from 3 feet to 3 feet
8 inches only below the level of the
road.</p>

<p class='c002'>Sanderson's Gardens.         Houses on each side below the level of
the pathway, which has a gutter in
the middle. (Lord Ashley spoke to
one of the inhabitants of this place.)</p>

<p class='c002'>Pitt Street, Bethnal Green Road.         A narrow street with only surface
drainage.          (Fever was very prevalent
here.)</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_161'></a>Cambden Gardens.             Houses built on the soil, many of them
not being larger than an 8-feet cube,
are inhabited.</p>

<p class='c002'>Lamb's Fields.               An acre at least of complete marsh and
three open ditches&mdash;one on the north,
another in the middle, and the third
to the eastern side close to the backs
of the houses in North Street.</p>

<p class='c002'>London Street.               Undrained.</p>

<p class='c002'>Rupia Lane.                  Two open ditches.</p>

<p class='c002'>Ann's Place.                 Open sewer in front of some of the
houses.</p>

<p class='c002'>Houses at the back of Ann's Place.        The open sewer from Ann's Place passes
beneath one of the houses and then is
again open to the houses at the back,
but is boarded in so that Lord Ashley
had to mount a boundary stone to obtain
the view of it.</p>

<p class='c002'>A group of streets to the north of Slacky Road.        All the houses stained with damp to a
height varying from 1 to 2 or more feet.</p>

<p class='c002'>Warmer Place.                An open sewer in front of the houses
giving off bubbles of gas very freely.</p>

<p class='c002'>Wellington Pond.             A large piece of water into which the
above sewer drains&mdash;gives off constantly
innumerable bubbles of gas,
and the stench is sometimes abominable.
Persons who have accidentally
fallen into it, though taken out
immediately, have all died.</p>

<p class='c002'>A thoroughfare leading from bottom of Pollards Row to Wellington Row.       The lucifer match manufactory faces
this road, into which we all went.
An open ditch in the most filthy condition.</p>

<p class='c002'>Squirries Street.            Green stagnant water on each side.</p>

<p class='c002'>Wellington Row.              Lower rooms all damp. An open ditch
in front. Western end soft mud, into
which the wheels of a waggon sank
14 or 15 inches as it passed.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_162'></a>North Street and some of the houses at the back.        Lord Ashley saw the landlord of some
of them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Waterloo Town (several streets).       All undrained, but part of Manchester
Street and Albion Street. Many
variations of level of several feet at
a distance of a few yards only, as
Manchester Place, Derbyshire Street,
Sale Street. Many of the houses
back to back and consisting of five
ground-floor rooms only.</p>
<p class='c006'><i>Second Visit.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>George Street.               A centre gutter full of stagnant water.</p>

<p class='c002'>Old Bethnal Green Road.            Has had a sewer made recently, but
houses do not communicate with it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Clare Street, Felix Street, Centre Street, Cambridge Circus, Minerva Street, Matilda
Street, Hope Street, Temple Street, Charles Street, Charlotte Street, Durham
Street. All built on undrained ground, and the houses affected with damp.</p>

<p class='c002'>Court opposite to Cambridge Road.  One privy to several houses, and mosses
growing on the damp brick of the
houses to the height of 4 or 5 feet
from the ground.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nova Scotia Gardens.         Several feet below the road in many
parts, the drainage of which it receives.
(Here lived the burkers of
the Italian boy.)</p>

<p class='c002'>Virginia Row, York Street, and the streets to the east.           Undrained, having stagnant water in
them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Rose Court.                  Most wretched hovels.</p>

<p class='c002'>Typen Street.                 (Where the child was burnt.)</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Page_163'></a>Satchwell Rents.             The privies form part of the ground-floor
of these houses. Lord Ashley
inspected the first house; <i>no</i> yards.</p>

<p class='c002'>Mount Street.                Level of the houses very uneven; many
below the level of the road. The undrained
portion of this street suffered
from fever to an awful extent, while
the high and drained part had
scarcely a case.</p>

<p class='c002'>Courts out of Mount Street.          Dung-heap in one. Lord Ashley saw
the landlord of another and spoke to
him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Collingwood Street.          Houses on one side much lower than
on the other; very badly drained, and
not a healthy-looking person or child
in the street.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
